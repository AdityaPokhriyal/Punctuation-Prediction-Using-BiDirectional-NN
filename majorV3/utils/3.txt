Good morning welcome to the course of Problem solving through programming in C This is a course of programming no doubt about it the first course on programming for many of you but also the focus of the course is to show you how we can carry out problem solving that means solving different problems using programming We encounter a different types of problems all the times in our life and some of them can be solved using programming why I am saying that some of them can be solved not all can be solved there is a reason for that we will come to that later also there is another thing in the bracket you can see that we will be discussing programming in C Now C why I have put it in the bracket the reason is the C is just one of the means one of the languages using which we can do programming there are different other languages like as many of you know Java C plus plus and others using which we can also do programming Now our objective is to not to just think about the c programming language but also some programming principles some programming logic some programming methods that are adopted while solving problems all right Let us think of some of the problems that we often encountered in our regular life let us start with a very simple problem of there is there is a large volume of data large volume of data maybe integer or may be numbers different types of numbers And we have to find the mean of that and mean of that many of you know mean is nothing but the same as average Now how do you find out the average of a large volume of numbers now all of you know how that is done that is a relatively simpler problem We can also have this is this has got some standard formula if you have got 4 numbers say x y z p you add them and divide them by 4 that is how we find out the average right Now also for n numbers if thereby n numbers then we can write it as sigma x i by n what does this mean this means I am taking what is xi xi is each numbers x1 is one number x2 is another number x3 is another number in that we are up to xn Now each of these numbers any of these numbers I can represent with xi and by replacing different values of i I can get any of these numbers So sum of all these numbers sum of all these numbers can be designated as x sigma of xi this sigma means summation and I do the summation of this and divide by n when it was 4 number I divide it with 4 here since there are n numbers I divide it with n This is a very well known mathematical formula mathematical approach that all of us the school children will Now therefore we can very easily translate this problem and solve this problem into programming we will see how we can translate it to programming also we will also discuss why we should translate it to programming all right Let us take a let it I mean a little different problem suppose there is a text all right there is a text of 20 sentences all right We will have a text of 20 sentences all sentences are here and I say that find out how many times the word human occurs in this text this is my text and I want to see how many times the word human occurs in this text also the problem can be much more complicated This is another type of problem where I have to look every word and see is it a human no is it a human yes So accordingly I will have to go on counting all right now I can also say that how many times does the word pair human being appear in this text so that is can also be I get human but I do not get being after that I do not count it all right If it be human followed by being then I count it once in that way I can formulate different steps by which I can solve this problem If you just spread your imagination you can think of making the problem even complicated for example human being and man woman child boy girl parent teacher etcetera all of them are human beings Now if the problem is posed in a way that find out how many times earlier what the problem was earlier the problem was how many times the word pair human being appeared as it is Now if I modify the problem statement and say that find out how many times human being has been referred to in this text that means if it be a man then also it is a human being if it be a woman then also it is a human being if it be a child then also it is a human being if it be a grand grandparent it is also human being In that case the problem becomes a little more difficult little more difficult than the previous version of it where we wanted to just find out the word pair human being this is an example of a second problem and third problem The third problem is a little more complicated as you can see we can go on adding examples of problems let us take another one suppose you have got a fixed amount of money All right whatever that amount is suppose you have got 1000 rupees and you have got you have been asked to buy some items may be rice wheat sugar vegetables etcetera and each of them have got a price rice may be rupees 50 wheat may be rupees 30 sugar may be rupees 70 and vegetables depending on the variety there are different prices all right Now suppose you have been told that you have been given this amount of money and you have to buy the maximum amount of rice possible the maximum amount of rice possible So with 50 rupees you can have 20 kgs of rice but there is a constraint there is a maximum amount of rice you have to buy but you have to buy at least 5 kg of wheat at least 2 kg of sugar at least some amount of vegetables Now given this you can buy 5 kg of wheat you can buy 6 kg of wheat 7 kg of wheat you can buy 2 kg of sugar or 3 kg of sugar etcetera you can do many things but you have to see that how you will distribute this so that even after satisfying these requirements you can find you can buy the maximum amount of rice
