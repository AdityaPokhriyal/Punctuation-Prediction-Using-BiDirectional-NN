mensional table ,COMMA  where I have got 5 .PERIOD  This is my x and this is my y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  5
corresponding to that 7 first row that is the first point .PERIOD  I could have taken 0 0 also that would be
another one .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  10 corresponding to that 16 then 15 corresponding to that 18 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in that way it could go on ;SEMICOLON 
that means ,COMMA  whatever is this function f x ,COMMA  a function can be represented as an array  ,COMMA  a 2
dimensional array so ,COMMA  that all as a table .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this we have to remember either as 1 array or as 2
arrays ,COMMA  because if this was integer this was float then I would have needed 2 different arrays .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here is a function now let us look at another aspect .PERIOD 

I do not have the function ,COMMA  but I have got some data right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here x and here is y and I have got
some data points for x equal to this is the y point  .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I call it x 0 this is y 0 .PERIOD  Next one could be
here - x 1 ,COMMA  it is y 1 .PERIOD  Here maybe it has come down for x 2 it is y 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I do not have a function
right now ,COMMA  but I have got different data points and I have to find out the function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is also
another very interesting thing finding out the function that can represent this distribution of data
points ,COMMA  might be here again there is x 3 and it is again gone up here .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it is not a straight line if I want to fit a curve to meet that how will that curve look like ?QUESTIONMARK  The
curve will be something like this right and I have to find out what function is this curve what is
the function .PERIOD  I do not know as it that is another challenging point .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  first of all graphs or data points graphs can be represented as table and the distribution of
data points can also be represented as table ,COMMA  because here in this scenario I do not have a
function ,COMMA  but certainly I have got the x and y values known to me .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  I can represent that
as a table .PERIOD  Another point to note here is that usually this independent variable the sampling points that I am taking our usual equidistant .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I can say x 1 minus x 0 is some value h x 2 minus x 1 will be the same h .PERIOD  Usually we
represent that in order to see a fixed incremental increase of the independent variable ,COMMA  how much
does the dependent variable vary ?QUESTIONMARK  .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can say in general x i plus 1 minus x i is equal to h right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is typically how we write now .PERIOD  We have got a number of problems to solve using data .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  for example ,COMMA  let us start with one problem finding the root of a function some function fx .PERIOD 
Now finding the root means essentially it is solving the equation .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I have got a function fx ,COMMA 
then my equation is fx equals 0 and I want to solve this right and I want to find out that root ,COMMA  at
least 1 root .PERIOD 

Now what do I mean by the root ?QUESTIONMARK  Say there is a function like this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  for what value of x f x
equal to 0 is the equation ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  this one is fx ,COMMA  y or fx .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we are to find out for what value of x ,COMMA 
for which value of x ,COMMA  f x is 0 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is the root .PERIOD  Now this particular function if this be an fx ,COMMA 
then it has got 2 distinct roots ,COMMA  another function could be something like this could be just like
this where I have got one root ,COMMA  this is the point where f x equal to 0 all right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  one of the major problems is finding out the root of a function or we will say in general the
root of a polynomial .PERIOD  Why are we saying a polynomial ?QUESTIONMARK  Because you know that any function say
fx is equal to 3 x squared plus 2 x plus 3 is a polynomial of degree 2 or this is f 1 x .PERIOD 

I could have another f 2 x ,COMMA  as 4 x this is a polynomial of the 4 x plus 3 maybe .PERIOD  Now anybody who
remembers cool coordinate geometry this is a linear equation ,COMMA  because it is a polynomial of
degree 1 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  if we say this to be y then this is y equals m x plus c .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  m this 4 is
nothing ,COMMA  but the slope of this straight line .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  there will be some slope of this straight line ,COMMA  this is linear  .PERIOD  This one is not linear this
quadratic .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can have the different functions which can be written as a polynomial and when
the polynomial is equated to 0 it becomes an equation and we want to solve that equation .PERIOD 
Problem number 2 is interpolating a function .PERIOD  I will describe what interpolation is a little
later .PERIOD But ,COMMA  before that let us try to see a very simple way of finding the root of a function ;SEMICOLON  say I
have got a function x and y alright and a function is something like this .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  I want to find out this point .PERIOD  What is the value of x ?QUESTIONMARK  This value ,COMMA  for which this y is 0 .PERIOD  Now
the method that we will be talking about is known as the bisection method .PERIOD  This is a very
common and interesting approach ,COMMA  you have seen in binary search also we have partitioned the
array into 2 halves and then went to one half .PERIOD  Very similar to that let us see how the bisection
method tries to find out the root .PERIOD  First we start finding 2 arbitrary points say x0 and x1 ,COMMA  such that
fx0 and fx1 are of different signs .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here you can see this is plus ,COMMA  this is minus .PERIOD  f x1 is the y
value corresponding to x 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if the y value of x0 and x1 are opposite then it is immediately
understood that the root must lie somewhere in between  .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we will then try to find out the midpoint of x0 and x1 .PERIOD  Suppose the midpoint of x0 and x1 is
x2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if x2 ,COMMA  fx 2 and f x0 are out of opposite sign ,COMMA  then the root must be I have (I have reduced
my space right) so ,COMMA  it is between x2 and x0 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I again find out the value the midpoint of x2 and
x0 .PERIOD  Suppose that midpoint is here ,COMMA  suppose this is x3 and these 2 fx3 and fx2 are of opposite
signs .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  I will find the mid midpoint of these 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  suppose the midpoint of these two is
this x 4 here .PERIOD 

Now still this one and this one are of opposite sides therefore ,COMMA  I will try to find out the midpoint
of these two .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will come somewhere here .PERIOD  In that way we approach till what till we find that
the value of y is very close to 0 ,COMMA  very close to 0 .PERIOD  Why am I saying very close to 0 not exactly 0
there are reasons for that ,COMMA  reasons we are coming to that .PERIOD  A computer works with finite
representation of numbers .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we may not get exact 0 ,COMMA  but suppose I get this and then I can assume that to be 0 because it is
very small and often we call it that that the value of fx at that point is less than equal to some
very small value epsilon that will decide a prior .PERIOD 

So ;SEMICOLON  however so ,COMMA  you have seen this approach .PERIOD  Now one thing that you can quickly think of that
how would I know that these 2 are of opposite signs fx 1 and fx 0 are of opposite signs ?QUESTIONMARK  If I take
the product of this if I take the product of this then ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA  if they are opposite signs the
product will be negative that is less than 0 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  at every point we check whether they are less than 0 .PERIOD  If there is no root ,COMMA  suppose it goes like
this then I will not find any point where they are of opposite signs ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is the basic idea of
bisection method .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  when I carry it out through a computer such attempts to solve such
problems known as programming numerical methods .PERIOD 

We will start with some representative ,COMMA  relatively easy one examples of those .PERIOD  Some numerical
methods ,COMMA  one of them is finding the root of a function ,COMMA  root of a polynomial .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  while doing
these numerical methods we always encounter errors and our algorithm will be better ,COMMA  if the error
is less .PERIOD  Now what do I mean by error ?QUESTIONMARK  Say ,COMMA  I am computing 4 by 3 .PERIOD Now what is the correct
result ,COMMA  the most accurate ?QUESTIONMARK  Do you know that no it is 1 .PERIOD 3 3 3 3 it goes on .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  you know our computers have got some storage locations of some 8 by 8 bits or 16 bits
like that .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  depending on that I have got a finite capacity to store the data .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  I may represent
this as says 1 .PERIOD 3 3 3 3 ,COMMA  I just start with say 6 digits all right ,COMMA  6 7 8 ;SEMICOLON  I can store 8 digits maximum .PERIOD  6
after decimal 1 decimal and this so ,COMMA  6 places .PERIOD 

Therefore ,COMMA  the actual thing was much more .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am actually committing some error .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the
error in computation is the exact value ,COMMA  the difference of the exact value ,COMMA  by this m and the
computed value ,COMMA  it can be positive or negative all right .PERIOD  Suppose the result is actually 1 .PERIOD 5 2 3 that
is the exact value suppose and during my computation I got 1 .PERIOD 5 2 2 8 2 3 then the error is the
difference between these 2 and the error is therefore ,COMMA  if I subtract this it will be 0 .PERIOD 0 0 .PERIOD 0 0 0 1 7 7 -
that is the error .PERIOD  Now the smaller this error is more accurate my result is .PERIOD  I think it is very clear .PERIOD 
Now there are 2 types of errors also ,COMMA  one is a round off error for example ,COMMA  here I could have
rounded it off as 1 .PERIOD 5 2 3 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  suppose the actual thing was this and I rounded it to 1 .PERIOD 5 2 by approximating if I go by 2 bits .PERIOD 
That is one type of error ,COMMA  other type of error is truncation error -this was there I have just dropped this 1 .PERIOD 5 2 ,COMMA  because I could not store more .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  there are two types of errors right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  truncation error and round off error .PERIOD  Another term that
you need to know is the absolute error -absolute error is nothing ,COMMA  but the absolute value of the
error and relative error is absolute error divided by exact value ,COMMA  the absolute of the exact value .PERIOD 
Absolute error is the error’s absolute part by the exact value and percentage error will be relative error times 1000 relative error times 1000 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we can say that percentage error is relative error in to 100  .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now just look at this have a quick look at these definitions .PERIOD  Absolute error means the absolute value of the error ,COMMA  relative error is absolute error divided by the exact value and then we come to the percentage error ,COMMA  which is relative error times 100 .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  another important thing that we have to consider is accumulated error ,COMMA  but that will
consider later .PERIOD  In the next lecture we will move .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  whatever we do the way we do the computation we must be very careful about the algorithm be such that it is it does not
accommodate too much error .PERIOD 

However ,COMMA  discussing about error analysis in general is beyond the scope of this course right now .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  we will in the next lecture start with the bisection method as I have explained and then move
to some other methods .PERIOD 

We were talking about errors and round off errors and percentage errors .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  I will briefly
show you that if we commit an error how that error continuously gets accumulated and
ultimately has a much larger effect .PERIOD 

For example ,COMMA  suppose the exact value is 9 .PERIOD 9 8 and we compute 10 all right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the inherent error ,COMMA  first the error actually is 0 .PERIOD 0 2 right .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  as we go on iterating suppose x 1 is 10 times x 0 ,COMMA  then the exact value should be 99 .PERIOD 8 ,COMMA  but
here we will get 100 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you can see that the error has increased to how much  ?QUESTIONMARK 0 .PERIOD 2 .PERIOD  Now if the
next iteration x 2 is again 10 times x 1 then it will be 9 9 8 whereas ,COMMA  the computed value will be
1000 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the error is becoming 2 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you see how with if we start with an inherent error how that error accumulates over time ?QUESTIONMARK 
Ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we can say a very important term is relative accumulation of error ,COMMA  which is accumulated
error divided by exact value for that iteration .PERIOD 

For example in the first iteration the accumulated error was 0 .PERIOD 0 2 divided by the exact value
which was 9 .PERIOD 9 8 ,COMMA  but later on it became 0 .PERIOD 2 divided by 99 .PERIOD 8 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is this was 0 .PERIOD 002004 ,COMMA  but
whatever that is it is not that important I do not want to confuse with you with this .PERIOD 

Now there are some cases where this accumulation of error actually goes on increasing .PERIOD  If the
rate of accumulation error decreases or if the rate of accumulated error increases ,COMMA  but the rate of relative error decreases ,COMMA  then we call it a stable algorithm .PERIOD 

However ,COMMA  I am not going into the details and the intricacies of this ,COMMA  but this is just to give you an
idea how the error propagates through iterations .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we must be very conscious about the rate of increase of this error  .PERIOD 

With these words we move to the algorithm which we are planning to discuss in this lecture that
is a bisection method .PERIOD 

I have already told you that the bisection method is given a particular function ,COMMA  some function ,COMMA  on this x and y axis .PERIOD If I have some function that moves in this way then we start with any two points any two points ,COMMA  arbitrary points here and maybe here ,COMMA  now these two points will not do .PERIOD 

Because if I select these two points then both of them are positive so ,COMMA  that if I had selected this
point for example ,COMMA  these two points x 0 and x 1 that would not have served my purpose because I do not know where the root is there or not .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I would rather select two points ,COMMA  which are of opposite signs and therefore ,COMMA  I know that
somewhere in between the root lies .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will take the midpoint of this ,COMMA  somehow here ,COMMA  if this
point is negative then I will keep the positive fixed and I will find out the value of y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these
two are opposite signs .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the root must be somewhere here .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  in that way I come to this one and find out the value of the root here .PERIOD  In that way I go on
dividing it till I come very close to the root as it is being shown here .PERIOD  It is very close to the root .PERIOD 
Now how close ,COMMA  that will depend on my decision that is the basic approach of bisection method .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  with that let us try to have a look at the algorithm ,COMMA  therefore ,COMMA  first we start ,COMMA  we define the
function f x and get the value of the interval A B that is there is a function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here there is a
function and the function can be long enough .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I take the limits ,COMMA  I have to find out the root
within this interval a and b and I find out how much error is required .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  how much error is
acceptable .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this allowed error is the epsilon that I was talking of and also the number of iterations ,COMMA 
because it may be that in some case I am not finding the root ,COMMA  because I am going on looking at
say for example ,COMMA  this sort of scenario and my a is here my b is here .PERIOD 

Then ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA  the root does not lie between this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will go on doing this bisection and
again i am doing this bisection ,COMMA  for how long will I go on ?QUESTIONMARK  But still it may be that I might not find
the root therefore ,COMMA  there is a maximum limit that is kept -number of iterations .PERIOD 

Now I initialise I to be 1 ,COMMA  just some index to be 1 and then I call a subroutine or a function ,COMMA  bisect
the midpoint .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here is a sub subroutine ,COMMA  you see what it does ?QUESTIONMARK  Or a function ,COMMA  What does it do
here ?QUESTIONMARK  It finds out between A and B the midpoint and increments the iteration and prints the value
of x 1 .PERIOD  x 1 is a middle point .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if my function was like this and this was a this was b ,COMMA  then the root mass lies somewhere
here .PERIOD  I find out the midpoint of this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this becomes x 1 .PERIOD  There is a next one and what is the
iteration ?QUESTIONMARK  Next ,COMMA is F ;SEMICOLON  that means F mid less than 0 ?QUESTIONMARK 

So ,COMMA  there can be 2 things .PERIOD  Here I select this to be my b and this to be my a .PERIOD  Now ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA  if I
take the midpoint then the midpoint will be somewhere here ,COMMA  a and b are of different signs .PERIOD  If F
mid is not less than 0 ,COMMA  then a should be x ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I will now move it on this side and this
should be the next a and between these two I will have to find out and every time I am trying to
find out -whatever value of F X that I compute ,COMMA  is it less than the absolute error  ?QUESTIONMARK  If yes then - x  ,COMMA 
I am getting my solution otherwise I am going on doing this .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is a flow chart of the whole thing ,COMMA  but I think you will be more interested in looking at
the algorithm .PERIOD  Let us look at the algorithm for a second and the program .PERIOD  Here is algorithm ,COMMA you
see this is much more understandable to you .PERIOD 

I read x 1 ,COMMA  x 2 and the error .PERIOD  Here x 1 and x 2 are the initial guesses all right .PERIOD  Here is my thing ,COMMA  I
have taken this is x 2 ,COMMA  this is x 1 .PERIOD  ‘e’ is absolute error ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  how much error is permissible ,COMMA  compute F 1 that is FX 1 ,COMMA  compute for this function this value and f 2 ,COMMA  compute this value  .PERIOD  If f 1 and f 2 ,COMMA  the product of these two is greater than 0  ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  my initial guesses are wrong ,COMMA  because both of them are positive ,COMMA  then I can do many things I will instead of going to 11(my initial guesses are wrong) I will again ask for new guess all right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I take a new guess and I find that it is less than 0 .PERIOD  Then I take in this step x 1 plus x 2  ,COMMA mid of that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  suppose mid of that is this one and that is becoming x ,COMMA  read this as fx 1 minus fx 2
divided by x is less than e then display x ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  if my error between these 2 points ,COMMA  the
difference is less is 0 .PERIOD 0 0 0 2 and that I can assume as 0 then I will display this particular value of x .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  right now it is not the case otherwise I will make this f to be fx I take this all right .PERIOD  Now
between these two I again divide ,COMMA  I come here and in this way I go on alright .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you will be
able to write the program as the program runs .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  just to show you (I am sure you can write the
program yourself) how can you translate this in the form of a code .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here you see let us try to understand this code it is a C program for the bisection method ,COMMA  I
have included a st stdio dot h ,COMMA  math dot h and there is some function ,COMMA  because I have to find the
root of a particular polynomial .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  for example ,COMMA  here it is given ,COMMA this is a polynomial .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is this polynomial it is x cube
minus 4 x minus 9 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that value of fx has to be computed .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the function is the fun ;SEMICOLON  fun is the
name of the function ,COMMA  then there is another function bisection ,COMMA  this function performs and prints
the result of one iteration .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it is a plus b by 2 ;SEMICOLON  now in an earlier lecture we had talked about this -what is this  ?QUESTIONMARK Because
here when I am calling this function ,COMMA  I am calling by reference how ?QUESTIONMARK  I am just passing the
address x and whatever I do here once again is a part of revision you can see .PERIOD  If I come here -
float star x ;SEMICOLON  that means what ?QUESTIONMARK  x is some variable and I have just passed the address of that .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  star x is the content of this ;SEMICOLON  say 50 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I passed it on and in the main function I am passing
on the address of x  .PERIOD  This we have seen earlier .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am taking the midpoint and incrementing
the iteration ;SEMICOLON  iteration is also a call by reference and float a float b are two points in between
which have been passed on .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  what is being done in the main function ?QUESTIONMARK  In the main function I am setting the iteration to
be 0 and here I am saying how many iterations are permitted ?QUESTIONMARK 

Maximum number of iterations ;SEMICOLON  x ,COMMA  a ,COMMA  b ,COMMA  allowed error and some x 1 value is given .PERIOD  Enter the
values of a ,COMMA  b ,COMMA  allowed error and maximum iterations .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  all these I read - the range a and b
between ,COMMA  which points I have to do ,COMMA  a and b and how much is the allowed error and what is the
maximum number of iterations ?QUESTIONMARK  Then with this I call bisection .PERIOD  What do I do ?QUESTIONMARK  Bisection and x ;SEMICOLON 
that means ,COMMA  this will give me the midpoint .PERIOD  I will call bisection here - a ,COMMA  b iterations .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  a is being passed here ,COMMA  b is being passed here ,COMMA  and the number of iterations is being passed
here .PERIOD  Now here I am finding the midpoint and that midpoint is being returned here is common
and then here at this point I call the function ;SEMICOLON  that is I am computing the polynomial .PERIOD 

If the polynomial ie the value of the polynomial at a ,COMMA  and the value of the polynomial at x  .PERIOD  there
is a midpoint that is less than 0 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what happened ?QUESTIONMARK  This was my scenario ,COMMA  here was a and here was b ,COMMA  now let me draw it .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here was b and here was a .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  what I do ?QUESTIONMARK  I got the meet point somewhere here ,COMMA  then
the value of the function at this point and the value of the function at this point is a negative .PERIOD 
Therefore ,COMMA  I move this b to x .PERIOD  x is becoming b and I do the same thing .PERIOD 

Otherwise if it was on the other side I would have made x to be a .PERIOD  Is this clear ?QUESTIONMARK  Then again I call
bisection .PERIOD  After calling bisection I find if the absolute error of x 1 minus x is less than the
allowed error ,COMMA  then I will print the root .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this will go on until I exceed the maximum iteration .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is how I code and all of you
should be able to practice this yourself .PERIOD  Next we will move to another algorithm ,COMMA  which is that
another method ,COMMA  which is known as the Newton-Raphson method .PERIOD 

This method adopts a different approach to find the root of the function let us try to understand
this briefly .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I have got a function like this ;SEMICOLON  now Newton-Raphson method ,COMMA  what it does is ,COMMA  it starts at
some x 0 and the corresponding value of the function at x 0 is f x 0 .PERIOD  Now what it does it finds out
the tangent at this point .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what would that tangent be ?QUESTIONMARK  That tangent is nothing ,COMMA  but f prime x
0  ,COMMA  because we know prime means d y dx .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I draw the tangent here ,COMMA  the tangent intersects the x axis at some point .PERIOD  Let this be the value x
1 ,COMMA  I drew the tangent and got the value x 1 .PERIOD  I come here and from here and from here for f x 1 at
every stage have to check whether the value is close to 0 or not ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA  this is not the case .PERIOD 

Therefore ,COMMA  I draw another tangent from here and what is this tangent ?QUESTIONMARK  This tangent is f dash x 1 ;SEMICOLON 
derivative at this point .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this becomes x 2 ,COMMA  now I find out f x 2 .PERIOD  Now I again compare whether
f x 2 to is very close to 0 or not .PERIOD  Still it is not the case .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I draw a tangent at this point .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is x 3 and I find out if x 3 .PERIOD  Suppose this value f x 3 is very close to 0 .PERIOD  Suppose this is
within my allowed error ,COMMA  then x 3 is the root .PERIOD  Otherwise if it was not there from here again I
would have to draw a tangent in this way it goes all right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is the essence of Newton-Raphsons method .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what are you doing here ?QUESTIONMARK  We are taking a function starting with a point and finding a tangent to that curve to the function at that point and see where that tangent intersects the x axis ,COMMA  from there I find out f x 2 and then I go on doing this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I think this geometrical exposition will be very helpful to you .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  next let us try to see how Newton-Raphson method works .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  at every stage x n plus 1 is x n minus f x n by f dash x n ,COMMA  why ?QUESTIONMARK  Because of the simple reason that I had this curve and this was my x n ,COMMA  from there I drew the tangent .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this was f x n and I drew the tangent here ,COMMA  then if I divide this and subtract from here I will get this x n plus 1 here .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you see it is coming in the other way because at every stage I am computing this .PERIOD  Next ,COMMA  here x n is the current known value of x ,COMMA  f x n represents the value of the function ,COMMA  f dashed x n is the derivative of the slope at that point ,COMMA  x n plus 1 represents the next x value that you are trying to find .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this expression is coming from the fact that f x by d x ,COMMA  where d x is delta minus x therefore ,COMMA 
the term f x by f dash takes is actually the value of d x that means ,COMMA  by how much I should count
down .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you can see from this expression f x by f prime x is f x by f x by delta x ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  the delta x ;SEMICOLON  actually this is the delta x part and that means ,COMMA  how I am shifting this x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the x was here and I am shifting it by delta x and coming here ,COMMA  again shifting it by delta x and coming here like that I am going all right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  suppose fx was x square minus 4 ,COMMA  then f prime x is obviously 2 x and x 0 was 6 ,COMMA  suppose I
assumed x 0 to be 6 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here is how it goes .PERIOD  First iteration x 0 is 6 ,COMMA  f x 0 is supposed 32 ,COMMA  32
because 6 squared 36 minus 4 .PERIOD  f prime x is what ?QUESTIONMARK  f prime x is 2 x that is 12 .PERIOD  This is x n and the
next value will be x n ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  6 minus 32 by 12 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  whatever that is I subtract and I get the
3 .PERIOD 3 3 next iteration I come to 3 .PERIOD 3 3 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it was something like this that I started with 6 and then I moved to 3 .PERIOD 3 3 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you see it is
converging very fast 3 .PERIOD 3 3 ,COMMA  then at 3 .PERIOD 3 3 the value of fx 1 is 7 .PERIOD 0 9 ,COMMA  here if you compute this ,COMMA  the
derivative will be twice of this ,COMMA  that is 6 .PERIOD 6 6 ,COMMA  derivative is 2 x ,COMMA  6 .PERIOD 6 6 .PERIOD  If I subtract this 6 .PERIOD 6 6
divided by 7 .PERIOD 0 9 ,COMMA  subtract it from 3 .PERIOD 3 3 is 2 .PERIOD 2 7 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my dx is 1 .PERIOD 0 6 .PERIOD  I go on like this and
ultimately I come to a dx of 0 .PERIOD 01 ,COMMA  I assume .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  next time it is 2 .PERIOD 2 7 .PERIOD  I start with that again find the next value to be 2 .PERIOD 2 7 so it will be 2 .PERIOD 0 1
and with 2 .PERIOD 0 1 I compute and gradually you see the dx is coming down .PERIOD  As the dx is coming

down ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I am approaching the actual root .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is Newton-Raphson method and we can very easily code it .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is an example .PERIOD  Now you can see this it starts with 6 goes to 3 .PERIOD 3 3 ,COMMA  then from 3 .PERIOD 3 3 ;SEMICOLON  I am
coming to 2 .PERIOD 2 .PERIOD 7 then from 2 .PERIOD 2 .PERIOD 7 ,COMMA  I am coming here and gradually the error is not increasing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
it is very much converging .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I get the solution with 2 .PERIOD 0 1 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  quickly the algorithm will look like this - again I will read x ,COMMA  the a maximum error allowed
number of iterations and d .PERIOD  d is for checking the slope ,COMMA  here are the comments - x is the initial
guess ,COMMA  absolutely error is e ,COMMA  n is the number of iterations .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  do in a loop ,COMMA  i to n in steps of 2 ,COMMA  f x f is equal to f x and then f 1 is f prime x .PERIOD  Now these are 2
functions ,COMMA  which you have to write and now why am I keeping this check ?QUESTIONMARK  Why am I keeping
this check ?QUESTIONMARK  f 1 which is a slope if f dashed x is too small ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  what that the slope is
nearly horizontal ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I am not going to get something like this .PERIOD  If I come to this point
and try to find a slope of this ,COMMA  the slope will be very horizontal .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is not a good choice .PERIOD  In that case I have to reduce it and come to a point ,COMMA  where I can find a slope all right .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  in that way I go on and find the whether it is coming to the close to the root and go on .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  if it goes on the iteration goes on say for example ,COMMA  it is possible that I am missing the loop ,COMMA  coming close to that- say a curve like this .PERIOD 

The slope of the curve was such that I was trying to come here and somehow I miss the root ,COMMA  I go to another point .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is another special case I need not bother you with that right now .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us have a quick look at the program .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here we are trying to find out the root of a function x log x to the base 10 minus 1 .PERIOD 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that
is the function that function is embodied in another C function .PERIOD  Now d f is nothing ,COMMA  but f dashed
x .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if this function is given ,COMMA  I also keep f dashed x written .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is f x ,COMMA  this is f dashed x .PERIOD  Now
I know I have already pre coded them and that will return me the value for different values of x .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now again I read as scan f ,COMMA  i read the initial x 0 ,COMMA  the allowed error ,COMMA  the maximum iteration .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  then in this loop what I do I find fx by f dashed x and that is h -how much I should change
the initial value .PERIOD  The initial value was x 0 with which I started ,COMMA  I subtract that and come to the
next point .PERIOD 

If absolute value at that point is less than error then that is a solution .PERIOD  Otherwise ,COMMA  I will go up and
repeat this .PERIOD  Now if I go on and ultimately if I overshoot the maximum iteration ,COMMA  then I can say
that the required solution does not converge or the iterations are inefficient .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  Newton-Raphson usually gives us a very fast way of finding the root ,COMMA  but sometimes it does
not converge and that is one problem of that .PERIOD  However ,COMMA  there are many other sophisticated ways
of finding roots ,COMMA  just to summarise I would like to say that what we have learnt in the past couple
of lectures is that one of the major technological requirements ,COMMA  a computational requirements are
finding roots of polynomials for many solutions for many engineering solutions .PERIOD  I have to solve
equations .PERIOD 

For that there are many methods we have just gone through to simpler methods one is the
bisection method and the other one that we saw just now is the Newton-Raphson method .PERIOD  Next
we look at something else called interpolation and other things .PERIOD 

Thank you .PERIOD 

Today we will first discuss a technique called interpolation .PERIOD  We have seen how a function can be
represented in a computer in the form of a table or a 2 2-dimensional array .PERIOD  Now what is
interpolation ?QUESTIONMARK  Let us try to understand .PERIOD 

Say ,COMMA  I have got a function ,COMMA  where I know the ,COMMA  I have got a function which is something like this .PERIOD 
But I do not know the function before that ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK  If I had known the function or tje
description of this function ,COMMA  in that case given any x ,COMMA  I could have found out the corresponding y ,COMMA 
right .PERIOD 

But suppose the function is not given ,COMMA  instead what is given to us are for some specific x’s (say x
1) I have been given this value ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK  This value of y .PERIOD  For x equal to 2 ,COMMA  I have been given this
value of y ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK  This particular value of y .PERIOD  Similarly ,COMMA  for 3 ,COMMA  I am given a particular value of

y ,COMMA  but I do not know what is the value of this function for 1 .PERIOD 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I call this to be the function f
of x ,COMMA  then f of 1 .PERIOD 5 is not known .PERIOD  Although I know that f of 1 is say something 2 .PERIOD 5 ,COMMA  I know f of 2
to be may be 3 .PERIOD 2 ,COMMA  f of 3 maybe something like 4 .PERIOD 

But this information is known to me .PERIOD  Given this known part ,COMMA  can I find out what are the
intermediate values for if 1 .PERIOD 58 ,COMMA  1 .PERIOD 3 ,COMMA  2 .PERIOD 5 ,COMMA  2 .PERIOD 6 ?QUESTIONMARK  That is the task of interpolation ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  given
some values known ,COMMA  I want to find out the value of the function for some independent value of
the dependent variable .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  for a particular x ,COMMA  what is the part ?QUESTIONMARK  What is the y ?QUESTIONMARK  That’s what I want
to find .PERIOD  Now you see you can look at this blue line and say that it’s so ,COMMA  simply you draw it like
this and you will find the value of y .PERIOD 

But unfortunately ,COMMA  what I have is not the blue line .PERIOD  What I have is only the rate crosses and this
line is not there .PERIOD  I do not know these 3 points - whether the curve is something like this or the
curve could be a straight line through this points ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  In that case you see ,COMMA  if it was the case ,COMMA 
then the value of x ,COMMA  this particular x would be different from this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have to actually see that
what is the curve that best fits all these given points .PERIOD  This problem is known as interpolation .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  I can extend it suppose some table is given to you ,COMMA  where values for f 1 ,COMMA  2 and 3 are given
and so ,COMMA  the range is from one to 3 ,COMMA  but you are asked for some particular x prime ,COMMA  which is
beyond this range .PERIOD  In that case it is also interpolation on the other side ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  beyond the
boundary .PERIOD  That is known as extrapolation ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK  Right now ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  basically the concept of
extrapolation and interpolation are always the same .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here what I will try to see is given some values of fx ,COMMA  some known of fx for some particular
x’s ,COMMA  how do you find out the value of fx for some intermediate value of x ?QUESTIONMARK  That is the task of
interpolation .PERIOD Now here I show I had shown a curve usually you can also start with a table like
this ,COMMA  where some x’s are given (Refer Slide Time: 06:03)say 0 .PERIOD 1 ,COMMA  0 .PERIOD 2 ,COMMA  0 .PERIOD 3 ,COMMA  0 .PERIOD 4 ,COMMA  0 .PERIOD 5 and for each of
them we have got some y value 2 .PERIOD 7 ,COMMA  3 .PERIOD 2 ,COMMA  1 .PERIOD 6 comes down again ,COMMA  say ,COMMA  0 .PERIOD 6 ,COMMA  and again it goes up say
3 .PERIOD 2 .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  if this be the table ,COMMA  then my question is for interpolation ,COMMA  what is the value ?QUESTIONMARK  What is the
value for x which is 0 .PERIOD 27 ?QUESTIONMARK  What is the value of this ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  that is the task of interpretation .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA 
obviously ,COMMA  a simplest possible thing is if I can fit in a line which is known as a linear
interpolation .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I have got some points here ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK  I try to fit in a line in between them or let me do it in a
different way not exactly this line ,COMMA  because this line is matching 2 points ,COMMA  but not the others .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is by y and this is x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  there could be some points like this something here and
something here like this equidistant points .PERIOD  Somehow I draw line like this .PERIOD  It is a straight line ,COMMA 
although my drawing is a little curved ,COMMA  but it is a straight line .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  one way is that I try to find out
a line such that I minimise the error .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  of course ,COMMA  if I assume that this line is representing my
function ,COMMA  then I can see there is some error here ,COMMA  there is some error here and in other places .PERIOD 

I could have fitted another line also ,COMMA  I could have changed this line a little bit .PERIOD  One of the ways is
to find the line that minimises the error .PERIOD  Now it depends on how you define the error ,COMMA  .PERIOD  Now here
you can see it is a negative error ,COMMA  it is a positive error ,COMMA  like that it can go on .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  one way is to
find the line such that the squared sum of squared error is minimised .PERIOD  That can be one way ;SEMICOLON  that
means ,COMMA  what is an error error ?QUESTIONMARK  When ei is (when I take whatever value my line is saying ,COMMA  let let
me call it li ) whatever is the actual value minus yi .PERIOD 

If I consider that to be the error or the other way ,COMMA  now you can see it is a positive or negative
when I take the error of all these .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that could be a sum of error .PERIOD  But here what I am saying is
that ,COMMA  I can have the square of this error ,COMMA  and I can try to find out a line such that ei square is
minimise so that I get a very good line .PERIOD  Now suppose I get a very good line like this ,COMMA  then I will
have I have the equation of that line .PERIOD  Now given 2 points it is very simple ,COMMA  right ,COMMA  let us take the
simplest case first .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if there be only 2 points given ,COMMA  then I can certainly draw a unique line between these 2 points ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  I can find out the equation of these .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is x or school level co ordinate geometry x1 ,COMMA  y 1 ,COMMA  x 2 ,COMMA  y 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you can find out the slope of this line .PERIOD  You can find the slope of this line ,COMMA which will be nothing but y 2 minus y 1 divided by x 2 minus x 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  once you get the slope ,COMMA then you can find out the line .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the school level equations like y minus y 1 is equal to m into x minus x 1 ,COMMA  where m is this m is a slope .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you can find the line so ,COMMA  when you find the line ,COMMA  then your problem is solved .PERIOD  Suppose you
get a line of the equation a x plus c ,COMMA  c is this and you get the coefficients like this .PERIOD  Now given any
x ,COMMA  I give x prime then from that equation I can straight way find the value of y a x prime plus c ,COMMA 
right ?QUESTIONMARK  That’s straight forward ,COMMA  but the problem is that often it is not only 2 points ,COMMA  but the points
are rather distributed as I was showing in the earlier one like this .PERIOD  Where I do not get an exact
line ;SEMICOLON  that is cutting through all the points .PERIOD  Here I will try to minimise the error and I will choose
such a line .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  when I choose such a line ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I have chosen an equation .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  again from
the linear equation ,COMMA  I can find out the value of y for any given x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this approach is known as
linear interpolation ;SEMICOLON  however ,COMMA  the linear interpolation often as you can see the error will be there .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  people try to find out more accurate solutions .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first of all we have seen what is linear
interpolation ,COMMA  the basic idea is very simple we try to fit in the best possible straight line ,COMMA  through
all the points .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that the error is minimised ,COMMA  total error is minimised .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  one way is to minimise the sum of the squares or there could be some other measures you
can take for error ,COMMA  that should be minimised so ,COMMA  you get a line to your satisfaction .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  once you
get a line to your satisfaction ,COMMA  you know the equation of the line .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  given any x you can
find the corresponding y .PERIOD  Now fitting this line always ,COMMA  the there may be situations where the
points are distributed in such a way for example points are something like this ,COMMA  all right ,COMMA  is very
difficult to find the line over here .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  often I I would like to find out a curve ,COMMA  or maybe another curve even better ,COMMA  that can be that
goes through these points like this ,COMMA  where I have got errors ,COMMA  but I am trying to fit in a curve .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
that is not a line ,COMMA  this is not a linear interpolation ,COMMA  where are further extensions like quadratic
interpolation ,COMMA  spline interpolation ,COMMA  cubic spline and all those .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is better to know the names ,COMMA 
spline interpolation ,COMMA  quadratic interpolation ,COMMA  where I want to fit in a quadratic curve etc .PERIOD 

But today we will discuss another interpolation technique which is known as LaGrange
interpolation ,COMMA  in the name of the mathematician who invented it .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us have a look at the
lagrange interpolation .PERIOD 

Interpolation as you have understood is given a set of k plus 1 data points - x 0 ,COMMA  y 0 ,COMMA  x 1 ,COMMA  y 1 ,COMMA  x 2 ,COMMA  y 2 like that up to x k ,COMMA y k ,COMMA  so many data points are given .PERIOD  The LaGrange polynomial is this - I
have to find out for a particular x ,COMMA  x minus xn divided by xj minus xm ,COMMA  where m is varying from
0 to k .PERIOD  For all these m is varying .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x 0 ,COMMA  x 1 ,COMMA  x 2 ,COMMA  x 3 for all these I will do that and xj minus
xm ,COMMA  where j is for a particular LaGrange interpolation .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you see it is for l 1 x it will be x minus x 0 by x 1 minus x 0  ,COMMA  x minus x 0 by x 1 minus x 0 ,COMMA 
like that it will go on ,COMMA  all right ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  this is the LaGrange polynomial .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  using this polynomial let
us see how it works ,COMMA  just to give you an example .PERIOD 

I have reproduced that polynomial ,COMMA  that I had shown in the earlier slide here again ,COMMA  you can say
this .PERIOD  Now suppose I have got the points given - look here ,COMMA  the points at a given are for x value 1 ,COMMA 
fx is 1 .PERIOD  For x value 2 ,COMMA  fx is 4 ,COMMA  3 and this 9 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have to fit in a polynomial .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my polynomial is
Lx ,COMMA  now each term of this is one lx .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is l 1 x ,COMMA  this is l 2 x ,COMMA  this is l 3 x ,COMMA  like that ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you
see the value of x is 1 ,COMMA  1 times x minus x m .PERIOD  M will be something that would be not the same as j .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it will be I have got the 3 points so ,COMMA  I will not take this 1 ,COMMA  x minus 2 divided by 1 minus 2
times the second term x minus 3 divided by 1 minus 3 plus 4 now I am taking this one so ,COMMA  it is 4
and ,COMMA  in that case ,COMMA  I leave out 2 ,COMMA  my x j is now 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x minus 1( I will not take x minus 2 here .PERIOD 
Because look at this m not equal to j .PERIOD So ,COMMA  for the other x’s ,COMMA  I have selected this row .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will only
concentrate on the other rows) divided by 2 minus 1 into x minus 3 the other row divided by 2
minus 3 .PERIOD  Here I take 9 - this value and I am taking this row .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  now I am taking this row ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  I have taken 9 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x minus 1 by 3 minus 1 ,COMMA  x minus 2
by 3 minus 2 .PERIOD  If I solve this I am getting a polynomial x square .PERIOD  Possibly you can see that is a
perfect fit with the given data points - x 1 ,COMMA  fx is x square ,COMMA  that is 1 ,COMMA  2 it is x square ,COMMA  4 ,COMMA  3 it is x
squared 9 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is in this case ,COMMA  there is no it is absolutely a perfect fit  .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is how I get the
polynomial ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK  Let us try once again .PERIOD  For these data value ,COMMA  for x 0 equal to 1 ,COMMA the fx is 1 ,COMMA 
for x equal to 2 it is 8 ,COMMA  for x equal to 3 it is 27 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  obviously ,COMMA  you can see it is no longer x square ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK  It is not also x cube ,COMMA  because here it is cube ,COMMA  it is matching the cube it is actually x cube ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  But let us try to fit in a polynomial
here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is that polynomial using the LaGrange method ,COMMA  I will first check one .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am
taking first row ,COMMA  taking this value one here ,COMMA  then x minus 2 ,COMMA  1 minus 2 .PERIOD  Times x minus 3 ,COMMA  1 minus
3 plus next time I take the second row .PERIOD  8 times x minus 1 divided by 2 minus 1 ,COMMA  because here it is the value is 2 .PERIOD  For the third row it will be again x minus 1 ,COMMA  3 minus 1 ,COMMA  x minus 2  ,COMMA  6 minus 2 .PERIOD 

By doing this I am not getting x cube which would be a perfect fit ,COMMA  but I am getting a close
enough polynomial which is 6 x square minus 11 x plus 6 ,COMMA  which will be approximating the cube
function very closely ,COMMA  you can see that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is not that LaGrange polynomial will always give
you the perfect fit ,COMMA  but it gives you a very close fit .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is what is known as LaGrange

interpolation .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I want to write a program and try to solve it ,COMMA  I left to implement a function ,COMMA  I
have to write a function that will implement this or this ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK 

Let us see how we can do that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here is an algorithm ,COMMA  scan the number of data available for x
and y values .PERIOD  Now here there is the how many data points ?QUESTIONMARK  This is telling how many data points ,COMMA 
you are finding the data .PERIOD  Now here loop for i equal to number of data factor ,COMMA  then here you are
computing this .PERIOD  Here you see what we are trying to do ?QUESTIONMARK  At this point we have just read the data ,COMMA 
and here in a loop we are trying to compute ,COMMA  here we are finding the sum .PERIOD 

But here in the loop ,COMMA  I am finding the factor so ,COMMA  if you go to the earlier the slide ,COMMA  you will find
that I have got these are my factors ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  I am finding each of these factors ,COMMA  I am multiplying
them ,COMMA  this is a factor ,COMMA  this whole thing is a factor ,COMMA  and then I multiply that with the coefficient and
add them up .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am doing the summation at the end .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here you see that I am taking the
factor then I am taking whatever is the value (this part you can yourself compute)

The key part is computation of the factor part ,COMMA  where I am showing this part ,COMMA  you can see that for
I 0 to data ,COMMA  i plus plus I am initially a factor is one .PERIOD 

Because I am multiplying that ,COMMA  then if i is not equal to j ,COMMA  I will take factor times the value minus
the data .PERIOD  So then ultimately ,COMMA  I am printing the coefficient .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you can translate that into in the
form of a c function .PERIOD  That is the basic idea of LaGrange interpolation ,COMMA  you can similarly write
programs for linear interpolation ,COMMA  and other interpretation techniques .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the point of this course

is not because I assume that you now know how to do programming and these are simple loop
type of programming .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you will be able to do that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  whenever you want to solve apply some numerical methods ,COMMA 
you will have to first look at the technique then try to find out the expression and you will have
to write an algorithm so that you can solve it ok .PERIOD  In the next lecture we will discuss 2 other very
interesting techniques for integration and differential equation solver .PERIOD 

Thank you .PERIOD 

In this lecture ,COMMA  we will be looking at another numerical method technique ;SEMICOLON  we will actually look
at two .PERIOD  First ,COMMA  we look at integration ,COMMA  how we can integrate a function ,COMMA  there are several methods
for doing that .PERIOD  We will look at only one method and you can after that ;SEMICOLON  you can look up at for
other methods .PERIOD  Next will proceed to see ,COMMA  how ordinary differential equation can be solved using
numerical techniques using program .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first of all let us start with integration .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  all of you know ;SEMICOLON  what integration means given a particular function integration is say I
have got a function like this and I want to integrate .PERIOD  Suppose this function is f x and I want to
integrate it within the range a and b .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we write that as integral a to b of f x and you also know
that this integration actually means the area that is under this curve .PERIOD  This value is the integration .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  we will look at how we can solved this problem .PERIOD  The simplest a very simple method is a
trapezoidal method which will discuss here .PERIOD 

Let me go back to this this case .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  you can see that I can approximate this curve in a very
simplistic case using a trapezoid .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have got a trapezoid here ,COMMA  let me draw in blue .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the
area under this trapezoid is approximating the area under the curve ,COMMA  but that is becoming possible here (except for this error) because the curve was very much not very skewed in that sense ,COMMA  but if the curve where something like this .PERIOD 

If it was something like this and I was trying to integrate it between these rangers then if I had
fitted a trapezoid here ,COMMA  then the amount of error would be much more because I will be
committing errors at this points .PERIOD  I am not considering this ,COMMA  I am over considering this points ,COMMA  etc .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the error will be more .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is not always the case that a simple trapezoid ,COMMA  one single
trapezoid will solve ,COMMA  but let us start with that and try to understand how we can go ahead with the problem .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the area under the curve in this particular curve as you can see here ,COMMA  this particular curve that has gone through this is a trapezoid ,COMMA  under the curve is a trapezoid .PERIOD  This part if I assumed to be a trapezoid in that case the integral of f x d x is the area of the trapezoid and we know that the area of a trapezoid is not nothing but half the sum of the parallel sides ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  f a plus f b divided by the height .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  if I look at it these are the parallel sides then the height is this - b minus a ,COMMA  this amount ,COMMA 
right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is a known result therefore ,COMMA  I can see if I can approximate a curve by a single
trapezoid in this way ,COMMA  b minus a times f a ,COMMA  f b plus f a by 2 or f a plus f b by 2 ,COMMA  but of course ,COMMA  we
will see that there can be errors due to this approximation ,COMMA  but this is a simple formula which we
can quickly compute .PERIOD  It is very easy to write a program for that ,COMMA  you have got a function that will

compute the curve .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you call it for a and call it for b and compute this expression ,COMMA  you will get
the integral all right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is an example why is it important suppose a vertical distance is covered by a rocket
from time 8 to 30 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my timeline is from 8 seconds to 30 seconds is given by this formula .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
the vertical distance overall ,COMMA  the total vertical distances is this is - a complicated formula .PERIOD  Now
using single segment trapezoidal rule ,COMMA  let us try to find the distance covered .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we know for 8 and for 30 ,COMMA  if I compute this function (this was my function) .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  for f 8 ,COMMA  my function is yielding this value and for f 30 ,COMMA  the function is yielding ,COMMA  this value .PERIOD  We
can compute ,COMMA  using your calculator you can find it out but you need not do right now .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you
can compute the values at these 2 points because this is the overall function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is the f 8
and f 30 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will be my integral ?QUESTIONMARK  My integral will therefore ,COMMA  be 30 minus 8 ,COMMA  b minus a  ,COMMA  f a
plus ab by 2 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that is coming to 11868 meter ,COMMA  the distance covered is this ,COMMA  but however ,COMMA  the exact value ;SEMICOLON  if
you computed the exact value if you do a detailed computation will be 11061 meter .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  there is
an error ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA  there is an error because I have approximated the curve using a trapezoid .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  let us see how great is the error  .PERIOD So ,COMMA  we can see that the true error is minus 807 meter ,COMMA 
right ;SEMICOLON  that is quite significant 800 meters and the absolute relative error which is the actual error
ie true value and the computed value and divided by the true value you find that I am getting
more than 7 percent error ,COMMA  how can you better it  ?QUESTIONMARK 

So ,COMMA  our answer will be instead of fitting in a single trapezoid ,COMMA  I can try to fit in more than one
trapezoid here like something like this - I fit in one trapezoid here ,COMMA  I fit in another trapezoid here
and hereby I can approximate ,COMMA  I can minimise my error to some extent .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here ;SEMICOLON  what we are trying to do instead of taking 8 and 30 and fitting in one trapezoid for the
whole thing what we are trying to do is we are fitting in one trapezoid for 8 to 19 and other for
19 to 30 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  again using the same formula we find then here is one 19 to 8 to 19 ,COMMA  this is the integral plus the other trapezoid is giving me this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am fitting in 2 trapezoids now .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if I do that ;SEMICOLON  then let us see whether the result is being bettered ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  I compute f 8 at f 30 and f19 and compute both of these values ,COMMA  the areas under the curve here and here and the result is
11266 meters .PERIOD  Now how far is it from the actual ?QUESTIONMARK 

Now you can see that the true error has reduced from 807 meters to 205 meters .PERIOD So ,COMMA  that tells us
that if we can extend this procedure and fitting more and smaller but more number of trapezoids
my error will come down further still .PERIOD  (Refer Slide Time: 09:34)

The multiple segment trapezoidal rule ;SEMICOLON  therefore ,COMMA  is that we divide into equal segments .PERIOD  So here
is one trapezoid here is another trapezoid here is another trapezoid and here is another trapezoid .PERIOD 
I am getting 4 trapezoids here and trying to formulate this .PERIOD  I can do that in this way .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the
integral is this whole thing which will be a sum of these trapezoids .PERIOD  Remember these lines ,COMMA  these distance is the same .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am dividing b minus a by some particular value n and that is my h .PERIOD So ,COMMA  this is h ,COMMA  this is h ,COMMA this is h like that I am going for equidistant points and drawing the trapezoid from there .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  therefore ,COMMA  if I follow this ,COMMA  as is shown in this way ,COMMA  the trapezoidal rule can be written as
integral from a to b is sum of half fn plus fn plus 1 ;SEMICOLON  that is f a plus f b by 2 times the particular
distance that is there ,COMMA  x o x 1 minus a ,COMMA  x 2 minus x 1 .PERIOD  Usually do it in the equidistant way .PERIOD 

Ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  multi segment trapezoidal rule is therefore ,COMMA  an integral I which can be broken
down ,COMMA  this is simple .PERIOD  From a to a plus h ,COMMA  I can have f x d x ,COMMA  a plus h to a plus 2 h f x d x plus a
plus n minus 2 h to a plus n minus 1 h f x d x a plus n minus 1 h to b .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  all the segment serving as it together .PERIOD  Applying this I get this formula b by a divided by 2 n
because 2 is coming n times .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  f a plus f b plus 2 into f a plus ih because that is coming twice
here once and here once ,COMMA  you see here if a plus h will come then here a plus h will come right  .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  using this let us do the example again the same thing using 2 segment Trapezoidal rule ,COMMA  we
could find that the error is coming down .PERIOD 

We have already seen that the true value of error is coming down .PERIOD 

And the absolute relative error has come to 1 .PERIOD 853 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now let us come to c programming ,COMMA  straightway ;SEMICOLON  how can we encode it using a c program ,COMMA 
you see here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am reproducing the result here again .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  integral of f x d x between a and b will be h by 2 f a plus 2 f a plus h plus 2 f a plus 2 h ,COMMA  why
this 2 is coming because in the first zone f a and f a plus h second zone f a plus h plus f a plus 2
h .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  each of these intermediate points are coming twice ,COMMA  that is why this is 2 and I have got this
formula .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  as a c programmer ,COMMA  your task is very simple you see here that I have defined n ,COMMA  i
whatever .PERIOD  I am asking the user for the necessary inputs .PERIOD  how many number of subintervals that
you want to have ?QUESTIONMARK  The initial limit a ,COMMA  you are reading the initial limit b ,COMMA  all those things you are
reading .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  the integral computation is done here .PERIOD  What is being done ?QUESTIONMARK  I am finding out the absolute
value of b ( b minus a divided by n and I am taking the absolute value of that) because it could
have gone on the other side also .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  here I am just computing the sum ,COMMA  what sum ?QUESTIONMARK  This
part .PERIOD  Initially x is a plus i h ,COMMA  sum is sum plus f x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  next time ,COMMA  it is becoming 2 ,COMMA I am adding all

those things here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here I am in a loop ,COMMA  I am doing a plus i h initially i is 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  1 h ,COMMA  2 h like
that I am going on .PERIOD 

Ultimately and I am completing the sum here ,COMMA  some plus f x and note that f x is a separate
function that is being kept somewhere here and then ultimately I find the sum ;SEMICOLON  sum is these
things - a plus h these points .PERIOD  Now integral is h by 2- this part ,COMMA  f a plus f b plus f a plus f b plus
twice the sum a plus a h ,COMMA  a plus 2 h ,COMMA  a plus k h like that t a plus i h has been completed inside this loop and that I had with 2 here and here is my integral .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is the trapezoidal rule .PERIOD 

The program is so simple ,COMMA  if you understand the concep .PERIOD  Next we will move to another very
important engineering computation that is needed in solving ordinary differential equations .PERIOD 
Quickly lets all of you know what a differential equation is .PERIOD 

We will in particular look at Runge Kutta fourth order method and here I will show examples
that you can also find in this site of University of South Florida ,COMMA  numerical methods and I have

taken the slides from them with the permission .PERIOD  Now you see how to write an ordinary
differential equation .PERIOD  Now an ordinary differential equation you know -it is d y d x f x y  .PERIOD 

So how do I write it ?QUESTIONMARK  I write it as suppose this is something that is given ,COMMA  d y d x plus 2 y is 1 .PERIOD 3
into e power minus x and what is this part ?QUESTIONMARK  This is the initial condition .PERIOD  Now this can be
rewritten as (just by changing the directions because I have to bring it to this form) d y d x is 1 .PERIOD 3
e minus x minus 2 y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in this case we will assume that our f x y  ,COMMA  there is a d y d x which is 1 .PERIOD 3
- this thing ten e to the power minus x minus 2 y this is our differential equation that we will
have to solve .PERIOD  (Refer Slide Time: 17:18)

So ,COMMA  for d y d x ,COMMA  the Runge Kutta fourth order method ,COMMA ( I am not going into the derivation of it for
positive of time and you can always look at look into this at any website or you can look at any
numerical method textbook) takes 4 terms and if this is the expression ,COMMA  given this d y d x my task
of solving a differential equation is to find a particular y ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK So ,COMMA  what we are trying to do y i
plus 1 is y i ;SEMICOLON  some particular y i plus 1 by 6 followed by a term and what is that term k 1 plus 2 k
2 plus 2 k 3 plus k 4 - this whole thing multiplied by h .PERIOD  H is the again the sampling that is the
distance between the individual points that we looked at ;SEMICOLON  now what is k 1 ?QUESTIONMARK 

When I am taking for y i ,COMMA  f x i y i - that particular function is k 1 .PERIOD  What is k 2  ?QUESTIONMARK  Suppose there
is a curve .PERIOD  Now I have been given the slope ,COMMA  I do not know the curve .PERIOD  If know the curve then I
can find out the value of any particular y i plus 1 given any y i .PERIOD  Now given any y i ,COMMA  I am trying to
guess the curve ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  I am trying to solve the curve .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x i was here ,COMMA  x i plus half h ,COMMA  I am taking
whatever was my h ,COMMA  I am taking half of h and what is the y part of this function y i plus half of k
1 h .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  because k 1 was f i ,COMMA  k 1 was the function that was giving y given an x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am taking this .PERIOD 
What is k 3 ?QUESTIONMARK  This part is same ,COMMA  x i plus half h ,COMMA  but this part is now becoming much more

predictive .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is half of k 2 h  ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  whatever has been completed here times h and k 4 is x i plus h ,COMMA  the last one is x i plus h because I am trying to solve the equation within this zone h .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  x i plus h ,COMMA  i start with x i and this is x i plus h times k 3 h .PERIOD  Here there is no half .PERIOD  Now this
derivation you can look at ,COMMA  but ultimately I multiply it with 1 by 6 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  given this Runge Kutta formula let us quickly look at an example ,COMMA  that we have a nice thing
to look at .PERIOD 

Suppose a ball is at 1200 Kelvin and is allowed to cool down in air in an ambient temperature of
300 Kelvin .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here the ball was heated and the air is cooling it down .PERIOD  Assuming that the heat is
lost only due to radiation the differential equation for the temperature is given here .PERIOD  This one ,COMMA 
where theta 0 ;SEMICOLON  we know the initial condition is 1200 Kelvin .PERIOD  Find the temperature at t 480 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
what is my x i ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  if I assume a step size of 240 ,COMMA  I want to find out the temperature at 480 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  suppose it was at a particular temperature after 480 seconds .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is the time ,COMMA  it was at 1200 and I have got some radiation formula using which it is
coming down .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I want to find out what would the temperature be at 480 seconds from the
starting point where it was at 1200 degree Kelvin .PERIOD  I want to find out this temperature .PERIOD  That is the
y i I want to find out  ,COMMA given the slope of this differential equation .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  assuming a step size of each to be 240 ,COMMA  if I take half of this then 240 then d theta d t ,COMMA  you can
compute that ,COMMA  here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my formula will be theta i plus k 1 plus 2 k 2 plus 2 k 3 plus k 4 divided
by 6 times h ;SEMICOLON  that is the Runge Kutta formula .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is what I want to find out  .PERIOD 

So step 1 - you see ,COMMA  I am not going into all these calculations ,COMMA  but I am finding out the value of k
1 .PERIOD  I am finding out the value of k 2 using this value of k 1 ,COMMA  k 1 is being used here and I find out
the value of k 2 .PERIOD  Again the value of k 2 is being used here ,COMMA  I find out the value of k 3 and k 3 is
being used here I find out the value of k 4 ,COMMA  I find out those values manually

So ,COMMA  the solution therefore ,COMMA  the theta 0 was 1200 ;SEMICOLON  initial condition and here I put in the values of
this times h ;SEMICOLON  h was 240 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have taken it at the midpoint .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I find that the temperature that
would be would be 675 .PERIOD 65 ;SEMICOLON  that is the approximate temperature at 240 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this will be the value
at 240 .PERIOD  Next I have to find out at 480 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what would I do ?QUESTIONMARK 

Step 2 ;SEMICOLON  I have taken had half point ,COMMA  I found out now my initial value theta 0 is changing .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  again do the same thing - find out k 1 ,COMMA find out k 2 ,COMMA  find out k 3 ,COMMA  find out k 4 .PERIOD  Now with this
initial condition (using the same function ) what will be h ;SEMICOLON  h will be again 240 because I have to
find it out at 480 degree temperature .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  I find out that using theta on is now 675 .PERIOD 65 that is approximate value that I got earlier
and I compute this .PERIOD  I find out using the same Runge Kutta method that this is the approximate
temperature at at 480 seconds which is 594 .PERIOD 91 degree Kelvin  .PERIOD  This is how we apply Runge
Kutta method and it’s very useful .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the exact solution of the differential equation is 647 .PERIOD 57 ,COMMA  if I solve it now ,COMMA  we got it ,COMMA  it was
how much 594 .PERIOD 91 and 594 .PERIOD 91 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it was not very far .PERIOD  It around 50 degree Kelvin ,COMMA  that is certainly an approximation .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now we have understood ;SEMICOLON  what is Runge Kutta method .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  I want to write a c program for it .PERIOD  Again you might find the approach to be mathematically
very novel maybe intricate ,COMMA  you may find some initial difficulty in understanding ,COMMA  but I am sure
you will understand it very fast ,COMMA  but you will see that encoding it as a c program is or as a
program is really simple .PERIOD  Now you are learning C ,COMMA  in future will be using MATLAB and other
things ,COMMA  you will be able to solve it very easily ,COMMA  I am showing you the c solution here .PERIOD  On this side ,COMMA 
I have kept what we learnt till now ,COMMA  y i plus 1 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  in our case the temperature at 480
degree ,COMMA  it is temperature at 240 degree plus this and k 1 is f x y ,COMMA  k 2 is f x i  ,COMMA this one f x i plus half
h plus y i plus half k 1 h etc .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now let us look at the program we have got the math function and everything ready .PERIOD  Now
somehow this function has to be written .PERIOD  Now this function  ,COMMA  here its being shown as a very
simple function ,COMMA  it can be any function ,COMMA  the differential equation function ,COMMA  the earlier functions
that we have shown or the thelog function which you will have to write .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here is an example
of a simple function ;SEMICOLON  x minus y by x plus y .PERIOD  With the dy dx given ,COMMA  that will come in this function .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  you see here I did how many times ?QUESTIONMARK  And h value ,COMMA  x 0 x 1 value ,COMMA  all these things I read .PERIOD 
Now the key things comes here ,COMMA  this is the implementation of the Runge Kutta method .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  very
simple ,COMMA  you see ,COMMA  I am computing k 1 ,COMMA  k one is f x 0 y 0 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I am coming to this function computing x 0 y 0 ,COMMA  then I am going back computing k 2 for x 0
plus h by 2 .PERIOD  h has been read  .PERIOD  This h has been read ,COMMA  then y 0 plus m 1 ,COMMA  I am sorry ,COMMA  here it should
be k 1  ,COMMA  this would be k 2 ,COMMA  all these m’s you should read it as k .PERIOD  This is k 3 ,COMMA   ,COMMA  this is k 2 times h .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  actually we are computing this thing straight way and then y is assigned y plus k h .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it will be this statement will be y plus k h and x plus h .PERIOD  I am incrementing x and going on .PERIOD  I
am doing it for 2 intervals till I come over here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I ultimately come to this print f and I print
the value of y for a particular x ;SEMICOLON  that is the Runge Kutta .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is in a straight way amenable to
some c program and for each of these f’s ,COMMA  you are calling the function every time ,COMMA  .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is the Runge Kutta method for solving a differential equation .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will encourage you to
look at other methods of a integration like Simpsons one third rule which is a very popular
method .PERIOD  This is known as Runge Kutta fourth order method because we are taking 4 terms ,COMMA  here ,COMMA  but this works very well for most of the engineering problems .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will encourage you to write programs on this and later on hence forth ,COMMA  we will move to another interesting aspect that is known as recursion a new style of programming which will take up in the next lecture .PERIOD 

Thank you .PERIOD 

Today ,COMMA  we will be discussing on a new concept of programming which is very interesting ,COMMA  but
possibly not very much familiar to you .PERIOD  That is known as Recursion .PERIOD  You know repetitions ;SEMICOLON  how
they are implemented in C programming .PERIOD  Whenever I want to do a particular work .PERIOD 

For example I want to add 10 numbers ,COMMA  then I add the sum with sum plus sum a i with i equal to
1 and then I repeat it i plus plus and I go on repeating it and this repetition is done in the form of
a for loop or while loop .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  recursion is a different way of doing this .PERIOD  When a function calls itself ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  a
function ;SEMICOLON  a particular function will have some inputs and we will deliver one output .PERIOD  Now you
know nesting of functions that in order to achieve this objective of taking these inputs and

delivering these outputs ,COMMA  a function could call other functions from another function and then
ultimately ,COMMA  return to this function which could be done and this was known as nesting .PERIOD 

But recursion is a little different ,COMMA  here there is a function which is supposed to be to deliver some
output .PERIOD  Now in order to do this ,COMMA  it is actually repeating itself ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  let me give you an
example .PERIOD  Suppose ,COMMA  I have a machine which can generate 1 apple ,COMMA  it can generate 1 apple ,COMMA  produce
1 apple or maybe let us say ,COMMA  it produces a vending machine which can deliver 1 coke ,COMMA  alright ,COMMA  1
piece of coke or1 can of coke .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you put in some input some commands and it gives you 1 coke .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  it has been asked to
deliver 5 cokes .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  how can you deliver 5 cokes ?QUESTIONMARK  It can deliver only 1 coke at a time .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  as we
know in our knowledge of iteration ,COMMA  this is some function ;SEMICOLON  function is delivering coke .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it can
be repeated ,COMMA  this switch can be pressed ,COMMA  there is a switch ,COMMA  it can be pressed 5 times .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first ,COMMA  1
coke comes out ,COMMA  second coke comes out so ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  this is being repeated 5 times .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that is the conventional way of iterating ,COMMA  repeating the same thing in order to get the 5 cokes .PERIOD 
Let us try to do it in another way ,COMMA  let us assume that this machine can deliver 1 coke at a time ,COMMA 
but it can also clone itself .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us see how it looks like .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I need 5 cokes but I can deliver only 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can deliver only 1 coke but I will not deliver it
till I am ensured that all the 5 cokes are deliverable .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what it does ?QUESTIONMARK  It clones itself makes another one copy of itself say and activates - this using
which I can deliver one coke .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I asked him to give a 4 cokes .PERIOD  Now this one can also deliver
only 1 coke and finds that ok ,COMMA  I cannot deliver everything .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I keep 1 coke ready ,COMMA  but I cloned
myself and another copy ,COMMA  I activate him - this machine and say please deliver 3 cokes ,COMMA  but it
cannot also deliver 3 cokes ,COMMA  it can deliver only 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  nothing is being delivered ,COMMA  but only kept
noted .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it puts somebody another clone please deliver 2 cokes ,COMMA  I have got 1 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it is also not delivering because it is not being able to satisfy the request of 2 cokes which has been opposed by this machine .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it now comes to another clone .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  asks this clone please

deliver 1 coke .PERIOD  Now as you know this machine can deliver 1 coke .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  it delivers 1 coke
and tells ok ,COMMA  I have delivered .PERIOD  Now this one ,COMMA  then since it has delivered ,COMMA  it delivers the other coke
which it could do  ,COMMA  it also tells it’s requestor ,COMMA  its earlier version that I have done my thing ,COMMA  you do
yours .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will it do ?QUESTIONMARK Remember it can only deliver one coke at a time .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it will deliver another coke ,COMMA  it passes on to its caller or its generator that I have delivered .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
it delivers the other coke and ultimately this one also knows that it’s child has delivered the coke .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  ultimately we get 5 cokes .PERIOD  This was one this is one way in which if each of this function ,COMMA 
each of these blocks ,COMMA  although they are the same function is being activated with different
requests and they are waiting till the request can be fulfilled .PERIOD 

But in the meanwhile it is passing on the request to another one and as soon as this could fulfil it ,COMMA  it passes it on and then it goes back .PERIOD  In the case of iteration what would have happened ?QUESTIONMARK  5 cokes would be generated by calling the same function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I call each of these as functions ,COMMA  then there is no difference between these function ,COMMA  the only difference is the value with which it is being called and this process is successful because ultimately there will be a situation when this function of this machine will be able to deliver what it has been asked to- deliver 1 coke .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
that will be done .PERIOD 

Therefore ,COMMA  we can go back and have everybody else deliver the same thing ,COMMA  this is the principle
of recursion .PERIOD  I just used it as a fun example ,COMMA  but let us now come to a little more serious look at
this .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it is a process by which a function calls itself repeatedly ,COMMA  either directly like X is calling X or
cyclically in a chain like X is calling Y ,COMMA  Y is calling X basically used for repetitive computations .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  the best thing is you look at this example .PERIOD  All of us know that factorial 5 is nothing ,COMMA  but 5 ,COMMA  4
times 4 ,COMMA  times 3 ,COMMA  times 2 ,COMMA  times 1 .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  you see the same thing ,COMMA  I can say ;SEMICOLON  what is this part ?QUESTIONMARK  4 multiplied by 3 multiplied by 2
multiplied by 1 ;SEMICOLON  this is factorial 4 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you see I am expressing factorial 5 ,COMMA  factorial function in
terms of itself .PERIOD  5 times factorial 4 and factorial 4 can again be expressed as 4 times factorial 3
and factorial 3 can be expressed as 3 times factorial 2 and factorial 2 and be expressed in terms
of factorial 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  4 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  2 and factorial 1 is the end .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am certainly getting the
factorial there without any further expansion .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we can write in general factorial of n is n times factorial of n minus 1 and factorial of n
minus 1 will be n minus 1 into factorial of n minus 2 ,COMMA  factorial of n minus 2 will be n minus 2
into factorial of n minus 3 .PERIOD  In that way it will go on ,COMMA  but it will be successful only if there is a
terminating point where which we often call the basis condition .PERIOD  I hope you have understood
this .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  two conditions are to be satisfied  ,COMMA  in order for us to write a recursive formula .PERIOD  One is - it
should be possible to express the problem in the recursive form just like factorial n is n times
factorial n minus 1 and also there is another point that is the problem statement must include a
stopping condition ,COMMA  what was my stopping condition in the case of factorial ?QUESTIONMARK  Factorial 1 is 1 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that was the stopping condition ;SEMICOLON  what was the stopping condition in the example of
delivering the coke ?QUESTIONMARK  When the machine was asked to deliver only 1 coke ,COMMA  then it can complete .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that is a stopping condition and then we go back .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the stopping factorial n is 1 if n is equal to 0 or n equal to 1 ,COMMA  otherwise ,COMMA  it is n into factorial n
minus 1 if n is greater than 0 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  ultimately ,COMMA  it will go on and ultimately ,COMMA  it will conclude .PERIOD 

Another example ;SEMICOLON  greatest common divisor ,COMMA  we can express that in a recursive form ,COMMA  it is very
interesting ,COMMA  you can look at it that the greatest common divisor of the same number is itself that
is the key to the logic .PERIOD  GCD of m and m is m and GCD of m and n is GCD of m minus n and n or
the other way .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  for example ,COMMA  GCD of 15 and 5 also 75 and 15 will be GCD of 60 and 15 ,COMMA 
GCD of 60 and 15 would be for GCD of 45 and 15 ,COMMA  GCD of 45 ,COMMA  15 would be GCD of 30 and 15 ,COMMA 
GCD of 30 and 15 will be GCD of 15 and 15 .PERIOD  Now I have got the stopping condition that GCD
of the same number will be 15 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  my result will be 15 is it clear ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  that is a recursive definition of GCD .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  most of the
interesting problems can be expressed in the form of in the recursive form and that helps in
writing a very second and tight code .PERIOD 

Here is another example of recursion Fibonacci series - a series like this one ,COMMA  then one ,COMMA  then 2 ,COMMA  2 is what the sum of the previous 2 elements 1 plus 1 and 3 ,COMMA  what is 3 ?QUESTIONMARK  3 is the sum of the previous two  ;SEMICOLON  2 and 1 ,COMMA  then 5 ,COMMA  what is 5 ?QUESTIONMARK  5 is the sum of the previous two .PERIOD 

Then 8 ;SEMICOLON  what is 8 ?QUESTIONMARK  8 is the sum of the previous two .PERIOD  5 and 3 ,COMMA  then 13 ,COMMA  what is 13 ?QUESTIONMARK  13 is the sum
of the previous two ,COMMA  8 and 5 ,COMMA  then 21 ;SEMICOLON  what is 21 ?QUESTIONMARK  21 is the sum of the previous two ,COMMA  13 and 8 ,COMMA 
you can see how nice this pattern is .PERIOD  Can you think of how we can write it in a recursive form ,COMMA 
how we can express it in a recursive form ?QUESTIONMARK  If you think a little bit ,COMMA  it will be very easy ,COMMA  it will be
something like Fibonacci number of n is Fibonacci of n minus 1 plus Fibonacci n minus 2 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  n 21- this one ,COMMA  is the sum of the earlier 2 Fibonacci sequences .PERIOD  Now f n minus 2 will be what
will be f n minus 3 plus f n minus 4 .PERIOD  Similarly ,COMMA  f n minus 1 will be f n minus 2 plus fn minus 3 in
that it will go on ,COMMA  but when will it stop ?QUESTIONMARK  The stopping condition is that Fibonacci of 1 is one .PERIOD  We
will see that .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if we try to express it in the recursive form ,COMMA  it turns out to be Fibonacci of 0 is 1 .PERIOD 

That means the first element is one ,COMMA Fibonacci of 1 is 1 .PERIOD  There is a second element ,COMMA  then Fibonacci
of n is Fibonacci of n minus 1 plus Fibonacci of n minus 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  suppose I give you
Fibonacci of 5 ,COMMA  how do you write that ?QUESTIONMARK  It will be Fibonacci of 5 ,COMMA  it will be Fibonacci of 4 plus
Fibonacci of 3 and Fibonacci of 3 will be Fibonacci of 2 plus Fibonacci of 1 and Fibonacci of 1
we know is 1 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I know this and then Fibonacci of 2 will be Fibonacci of 1 plus Fibonacci of 0 ,COMMA  I know that
this is 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I get this ;SEMICOLON  this is done .PERIOD  Similarly ,COMMA  once this is done I got this number .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what
would that be ?QUESTIONMARK  This will be 2 and so third one will be 2 ,COMMA  then Fibonacci of 4 will be 2 plus 3 ,COMMA  5 ;SEMICOLON 
in that way it will go on .PERIOD  Now we see ;SEMICOLON  how we can write a function ,COMMA  how we can express this
Fibonacci or this factorial ,COMMA  the recursive expression in the form of a function .PERIOD 

Let us see here ,COMMA  I am writing this ,COMMA  you had seen earlier functions written for factorial .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you can see factorial n is if n equal to 0 ,COMMA  return 1 ,COMMA  otherwise return n times factorial n minus 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will happen ?QUESTIONMARK  How will this be executed ?QUESTIONMARK  What will it return ?QUESTIONMARK  While returning ,COMMA  it will again call this function ,COMMA  again ,COMMA  this function will start in the same way just by replacing n with n minus 1
and here ,COMMA  it will come out with n minus 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will again be called with n minus 2 and so on
and so forth .PERIOD It will go on .PERIOD  Now how is that executed ?QUESTIONMARK 

The function as I said is not executed immediately ,COMMA  when I asked that coke machine to deliver 5
cokes ,COMMA  it did not deliver immediately ,COMMA  it could deliver 1 coke ,COMMA  but held it back ,COMMA  but created another
machine to deliver n minus 1 cokes and that machine held it back and generated another machine
to deliver n minus 2 cokes .PERIOD  In this way ,COMMA  it went on .PERIOD  They are kept aside on a stack one after
another until the stopping condition is encountered .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it remembered that I have to deliver one .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if you look at this ,COMMA  I do not know whether that will visible or not .PERIOD  Here here you see
everybody remembered that I have to deliver ,COMMA  but they did not deliver ,COMMA  when the stopping
condition was met after that this back chain started .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  they are kept aside ,COMMA  but not delivered
immediately .PERIOD  Then the function calls are executed in reverse order .PERIOD  Again you can see that they
are executed in reverse order in order to get the solution .PERIOD 

Say I am calculating factorial 4 ,COMMA  first the function calls will be processed .PERIOD  Factorial 4 is factorial
4 times factorial 3 ,COMMA  then factorial 3 is 3 times factorial 2 ,COMMA  factorial 2 is 2 times factorial 1 ;SEMICOLON 
factorial 1 is 1 times factorial 0 and factorial 0 is 1 .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  the actual values will return in the reverse order ;SEMICOLON  1 into 1 is 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  factorial 1 is complete .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  1 into 2 is 2 that goes here ,COMMA  fact 2 is 2 ,COMMA  in that way ,COMMA  it goes on .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it goes back in this

direction ultimately ,COMMA  we get the result from here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the actual values return in reverse order .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  factorial 0 is 1 ,COMMA  factorial 1 is 1 times 1 is 1 ,COMMA  now the reverse order is being done 2 into 1 is 2 ,COMMA  3 into 2 is 6 and 4 into 6 ,COMMA  6 ;SEMICOLON  24 in that way ,COMMA  it is being computed .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is a stack .PERIOD  Stack is a data structure ,COMMA  stack is a way of storing data where we stored the
data just where whatever comes in first ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA  goes out last because if I put something here
and above that I put something just like a stack of books ,COMMA  you will have to take it out in the other
way ,COMMA  this one will come out first then this one will come out then this one will come out .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let
us see how it works .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  factorial 4 ,COMMA  factor step 0 executes factorial 4 .PERIOD  Now return 4 times factorial 3 ,COMMA  you see here is
the recursive call ,COMMA  it is calling itself return 4 times factorial 3 ,COMMA  what is factorial 3 ,COMMA  oh you do not
know ;SEMICOLON  what is factorial 3 ?QUESTIONMARK  Return 3 times factorial true 2 .PERIOD  Oh you do not know ;SEMICOLON  what is factorial
clue 2  ?QUESTIONMARK  Then return 2 into factorial 1 or you still do not know ;SEMICOLON  what is factorial 1 ?QUESTIONMARK  Return 1 into
factorial 0 and so ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  you know factorial 0 is 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you get 1 and now you could not answer
these questions earlier so I have broken it down and given you an easier solution .PERIOD 

And so ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  you go back here and you return one into one then you go back here ,COMMA  return 1 into
2 ,COMMA  return 2 and you go back here  .PERIOD  This is what is meant by recursion if we redo it if we .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is the computer implementation of that factorial if n is less than 0 ,COMMA  return 1 ,COMMA  return n
times factorial n minus 1 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  computes 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is again recursively expressing itself f 4 is being expressed in terms of f 3 ,COMMA  everything is being expressed ,COMMA  f is being expressed in terms of f ,COMMA  f 3 is being expressed in terms of f 2 ,COMMA  f 2 is being expressed in terms of f 1 ,COMMA  f 1 is being expressed in terms of f 0 and I know what f 0 is .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  f 0 is 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I go back and I know that now f 0 is 1 .PERIOD 

Therefore f 1 is 1 into 1 and in this way ,COMMA  I go back .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  you see it had expanded in this way .PERIOD 
Now it is shrinking 1 into 1 is 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  I know factorial 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this will shrink ;SEMICOLON  now I know
what is factorial 2 that is 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this will shrink 3 into 2 ;SEMICOLON  6 ,COMMA  it is shrinking coming here - 24 and
then here it is 120 ;SEMICOLON  that is how as if in a spring it got expanded and then it contracted back ,COMMA  this is recursion return it ultimately returns factorial 5 to be 120 .PERIOD 

Another example will be Fibonacci number .PERIOD  We will explain it in the next lecture .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we are looking at recursion and that is a new style of programming where we can express a
particular function in terms of itself like I can express factorial n in terms of factorial n into
factorial n minus 1 ok .PERIOD  Another very common example and easy example of recursion is
Fibonacci numbers ,COMMA  we have already told you ;SEMICOLON  what Fibonacci sequence is ,COMMA the Fibonacci
sequence can be expressed as f 0 ,COMMA  the 0th Fibonacci number is 0 .PERIOD  The next one is also 1 .PERIOD 

And henceforth ,COMMA  all other ones are sum of the previous two ;SEMICOLON  so ,COMMA  0 ,COMMA  1 ,COMMA  1 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  8 ,COMMA  13 ,COMMA  21 ,COMMA  so and
so forth .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  we should be able to define it in terms of a recursive function because you
can see this function f and this function f are the same ,COMMA  only variations are in these parameters .PERIOD  I
am expressing the same function in terms of these parameters .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the function definition will be
is very simple f ;SEMICOLON  int end some integer ,COMMA  if n is less than 2 ,COMMA  then return n if n is less than 2 if it is 0
then 0 .PERIOD 

If it is 1 ,COMMA  then it is 1 ,COMMA  otherwise what did you return ?QUESTIONMARK  Return f n minus 1 plus f n minus 2 ,COMMA  sum of
the previous 2 Fibonacci numbers .PERIOD  Now this is interesting because again if you see how this will
be computed ,COMMA  it will be first expanding what are the things I have to compute and when it meets
stopping condition then it starts collecting back and comes back .PERIOD 

If I want to compute Fibonacci of 4 ,COMMA  how many times will that function be called ?QUESTIONMARK  Let us look at
the expansion of this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  how will it happen ?QUESTIONMARK  I want to compute Fibonacci of 4 which is
Fibonacci of 3 ,COMMA Fibonacci of 2 ,COMMA  these 2 should be added .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have not yet have found out
anything ,COMMA  I am just decomposing the problem  .PERIOD 

There is a very very important concept that in order to solve the problem ,COMMA  I want to decompose it
into smaller sub problems .PERIOD  For f 4 ,COMMA  I have to solve it by solving f 3 and f 2 .PERIOD  Now for solving f 3 ,COMMA  I
have to solve f 2 and f 1 ,COMMA  I further decomposed it .PERIOD  Now for solving f 2 I have to solve f 1 and f 0 .PERIOD 
Even now the entire thing has not been broken down ,COMMA  f 2 ,COMMA  for that I have to solve f 1 and f 0 .PERIOD  Now I have expanded the whole thing .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  I know that f 1 is 1 ,COMMA  f 0 is 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  f 2 will be 1 plus 1 ;SEMICOLON  2 ,COMMA  this is known ,COMMA  all these endpoints of
this structure are known - 1 0 ,COMMA  1 ,COMMA  1 ,COMMA  0 ,COMMA  1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I go on adding them and ultimately ,COMMA  I will get f 4 .PERIOD 
Now it is in a way inefficient ,COMMA  because the same thing is being computed repeatedly ,COMMA  but to a practiced programmer ,COMMA  it will make your programming much more easier ,COMMA  I mean less line lines
of codes if you can express it in a much better way .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you can see here ;SEMICOLON  how many times the function was called ?QUESTIONMARK  1 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  4 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  7 ,COMMA  8 ,COMMA  9 times ;SEMICOLON  9
times the same function was called in order to compute f 4 .PERIOD 

Now the stopping condition of the base condition is very very important .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if n is 0 or n is 1 ,COMMA 
then I return 1 ,COMMA  this is the base case ,COMMA  unless I reach at this point ,COMMA  I will not be able to compute the entire solution .PERIOD 

Return Fibonacci of n minus 1 plus Fibonacci of n minus 2 - that is the code for the Fibonacci
number .PERIOD  Now whenever I will have too many calls in that case ,COMMA  I should avoid them as much as
possible and .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is the difference ?QUESTIONMARK 

Between recursion and iteration ?QUESTIONMARK  In iteration there is an explicit loop for i equals 0 ,COMMA  i less than
equal to n minus 1 i plus plus .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  there is an explicit loop whereas ,COMMA  in case of recursion ,COMMA  it is repeated function calls .PERIOD 
Termination iteration if the loop condition is no longer satisfied while this condition do ,COMMA  if that
condition fails ,COMMA  then we come out of the loop .PERIOD  In the case of recursion ,COMMA  the base condition must be recognised whenever we are getting the base condition ;SEMICOLON  factorial one or factorial 0 Fibonacci of 0 or Fibonacci of 1 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  those are the base conditions ,COMMA  if wrongly programmed both can have infinite loop .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the
performance wise iteration often gives faster result ,COMMA  but it is a good software engineering practice to gradually get accustomed to recursion as you do more and more programming ,COMMA  you will see that you will be able to express the things in a much subtler way .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  whenever there is a performance issue try to avoid recursion ,COMMA  it will require additional
memory also .PERIOD  There is a particular type of storage that is required in recursion that is known as
stack .PERIOD  Stack is a last in first out type of structure .PERIOD 

Briefly ,COMMA  let me tell you ;SEMICOLON  how this thing is done because stack is nothing ,COMMA  but a structure where we
can push in data from one side - say I put say 5 first ,COMMA  I push .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  5 comes here ,COMMA  then I push 4 ,COMMA  then
I do n minus 1 ,COMMA  3 is pushed ,COMMA  then 2 is pushed then n minus 1 again and 1 is pushed .PERIOD  Now when I
take out the data ,COMMA  the data will come out as 1 ,COMMA  then 2 ,COMMA  then 3 ,COMMA  then 4 ,COMMA  then 5 in the reverse order  .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  the 2 operations are push and pop .PERIOD 

Popping out from the stack and pushing inside the stack .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this stack data structure becomes very handy for implementation of function ,COMMA recursive
functions ,COMMA  we will show some examples .PERIOD 

Like here for example ,COMMA  I want to compute the gcd of a b .PERIOD  Now typically what happens is I call
this ,COMMA  gcd is computed ,COMMA I return .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  here when I call something say ;SEMICOLON  I was here ,COMMA  my program flow was here I went in .PERIOD  So when
I went in all the local variables and everything here were stored and I had to remember where I
will be returning back .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  all those things are stored in the stack and without a stack data
structure ,COMMA  it is very difficult to implement recursion and for that matter any function call .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you see here is a function and so all those return addresses are stored ,COMMA  before call this stack
was empty ,COMMA  now after its returning it is taking out from the top of the stack and again I come to
know where I was .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that is so ,COMMA  similarly you see here .PERIOD  N choose r a b ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  n c r  .PERIOD  n choose r ,COMMA  if I compute ,COMMA 
then n choose r is factorial r divided by factorial of n minus r or some people write it in this way
- factorial of n minus r .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  how did I do that ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  how can I implement it ?QUESTIONMARK 

So ,COMMA  here n c r has been called from here factorial has been called and then where do I return ?QUESTIONMARK  I
have to come here ,COMMA  ultimately I have to return here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I should not lose the path .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what the stack does is when I make the call ,COMMA the first call the local variables here will be
stored here on the stack and again I make another call from here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  local variables are there ,COMMA  I
am calling fact ,COMMA  as I go in here ,COMMA  the local variables here has stacked up and then when I return this part will be taken out and passed on to this .PERIOD 

So as it returns this part is taken out and I am here ,COMMA  it can again continue and then it returns ,COMMA 
when it returns here this part will be taken out  .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that is for normal function call ,COMMA  how the stack remembers where I should go back .PERIOD  In the case
of recursive calls what happens what we have seen is activation record gets pushed into the stack
when a function I will call is made .PERIOD  In recursion a function calls itself .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  several function calls are going on with none of the calls getting back .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  all the activation
records are collected .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you need not delve into that too much .PERIOD 

I will show it by an example of a computing factorial .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  an activation record is the local
variables and the return value ,COMMA  what the function should return and where it should return .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that with that say the main function is calling fact 3 and here is a fact n ,COMMA  if n equal to 0 return
one otherwise n times fact n minus 1 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  main calls fact .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  when it calls the value n is equal to 3 ,COMMA so there is no return value ,COMMA  the
return address is in the main I am remembering that .PERIOD  Next again fact is calling itself ;SEMICOLON  so ,COMMA  now ,COMMA 
fact is calling fact 3 is calling fact 2 and my return address is fact .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you see it has been stacked up .PERIOD  Next fact 2 will call fact 1 ,COMMA  so what is this ?QUESTIONMARK  The stack is growing and its return is in fact .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  next time ,COMMA  it will be fact 0 .PERIOD  Till now ,COMMA  there was no return value .PERIOD  Now the return value is 1
and return addresses fact .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  as I do that I return ,COMMA  then I have got a return value because now I
have come to this point .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  1 into 1 will be 1 and I am returning to fact ,COMMA  as I return the stack will
contract and what is the return result ?QUESTIONMARK  2 times 1 that is 2 ,COMMA  that is a factorial 2 and I am returning
to fact .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I return again .PERIOD  Now I am coming for last time in the fact with n equal to 3 that started
here .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  and the result is 6 .PERIOD  Now I return to main .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  at every stage look at this ,COMMA  I know I remember
from where I started and from where I am returning back ,COMMA  nothing is lost using this stack .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
stack is a very interesting data structure ,COMMA  that helps us in many ways ,COMMA  especially in implementing
things like recursion .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  one assignment that I am leaving to you do it yourself ,COMMA  trace the activation record for the
following version of Fibonacci .PERIOD  Please note down the code include stdio dot h ,COMMA  int f ,COMMA  f is the
Fibonacci function ,COMMA  a and b if n is less than 2 return n  ,COMMA if it is 0 then return 0 .PERIOD 

If it is 1 return 1 ,COMMA  otherwise a is fn minus 1 ,COMMA  b is fn minus 2 ,COMMA  I have done it in a different way ,COMMA  fn
minus 1 and fn minus 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if n minus 1 has to be solved separately and fn minus 2 should be
solved separately ,COMMA  then we will return a plus b ,COMMA  then the main will print .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  just for fun you try to
draw the activation record of this version of the function ,COMMA  please note it down ,COMMA  take some time
and note down this function and you see on this side I have shown .PERIOD 

How the activation record will look like local variables ,COMMA  you can see n ,COMMA  a and b .PERIOD  Return value you
have to keep whether it is in Fibonacci or in main ,COMMA  either in main or in x or y ,COMMA   .PERIOD  This is x and this
is y ,COMMA  alright not these 2  ,COMMA these are not aligned properly .PERIOD 

Here is the return to the main ,COMMA  either return to main or to x or to y and what is the return value ?QUESTIONMARK 
Draw the activation record of this and then ,COMMA  we will see how much you could do it I am sure you
will be able to do it .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  today we have learnt a new style of programming that is recursion and also we discussed in the last class .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  recursion is a type of writing functions where the function calls itself and that makes many functions to be written much more subtle and that is a very good software engineering practice .PERIOD 

Although as a beginner ,COMMA  If you find difficulty in that ;SEMICOLON  you need not bother too much about it ,COMMA  you
have got iteration at your disposal and you can solve most of the problems with iteration ,COMMA 
practically all the problems ,COMMA  you can do .PERIOD  May be in some cases ,COMMA  it may be a little more difficult to
write ,COMMA  but ultimately it is will be possible .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if you find difficulty with recursion ,COMMA  you can set it
aside for the time being ,COMMA  but we have to discuss it because that is a very nice way of writing
functions ,COMMA  we will continue with the concept of structures in the next lecture ,COMMA  a new thing will be
introduced that is called structure .PERIOD 

Thank you .PERIOD 

Earlier ,COMMA  we had talked about storage of data in arrays .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  what we found ;SEMICOLON  what we mentioned
in the case of arrays is that in an array we can store data only of a particular type ;SEMICOLON  say an array of integers or an array of floats or an array of characters ,COMMA  but we could not mix different types in the same array .PERIOD  For example ,COMMA  we had faced the problem of representing the student’s database where we will have the student’s name as well as the student’s marks .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we needed something like this ;SEMICOLON  actually that is what was desired ;SEMICOLON  that will have the names
here and the names will be nothing but an array of characters .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here will be some names ABC and here will be the marks 56 A .PERIOD  Now this representation requires two arrays ;SEMICOLON  one is the
representing the names and the other is representing marks  .PERIOD 

Now ;SEMICOLON  however ,COMMA  as the diagram is showing here ,COMMA  we are trying to represent them in an unified
structure in the same structure ,COMMA  but that is not possible in the case of an array ,COMMA  here we have got 2

different data types .PERIOD  This is an array of characters and this is an integer .PERIOD  For example ,COMMA  we can we can see that if I had stored something lets say  .PERIOD 

For example ,COMMA  I want to store a graph where at every point ;SEMICOLON  1 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3 seconds for example ,COMMA  this time
in seconds and here I am measuring the temperature and if I have a graph which is something
like this ,COMMA  I cannot say that at every point ,COMMA  the temperature will also be an integer therefore .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  suppose here at point number 2 ,COMMA  the temperature is 50 .PERIOD 34 ,COMMA  at point number 3 ,COMMA  the temperature can be 70 .PERIOD 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I had tried to represent that in the form of a 2D array ,COMMA  in that case ,COMMA  it wouldn’t have been possible because a 2D array is also an array and therefore is of only one type .PERIOD  We have to declare a 2D array as an array of integer or as an array of characters or array of float .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I cannot represent that in a 2D array where one side say for example one column will be
temperature and another column will be the time ;SEMICOLON  its time and temperature .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that wont
possibly be executed in a 2 dimensional array because while time will be an integer (1 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3)
temperatures can be something different 50 .PERIOD 6 ,COMMA  70 .PERIOD 3 ,COMMA  etc .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  an array is not possible .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  our question is then what is the type of data structure ;SEMICOLON  what is the type of arrangement by
which I can represent data of different types together  ?QUESTIONMARK  The answer to that is what we will be
looking at today that is structure .PERIOD  Structures in C allows us to represent a combination of
different data types .PERIOD 

For example ,COMMA  let me give an example of a structure ,COMMA  say I want to define student data and student data will consist of the student name ,COMMA  lets say the department of the student ,COMMA  roll number of the student ,COMMA  may be the CGPA of the student ,COMMA  grade ,COMMA  point ,COMMA  average of the student ,COMMA  etc .PERIOD 

If I want to store them together as a common piece ,COMMA  the student data ,COMMA  then this entire thing has got components of different data types .PERIOD  For example ,COMMA  what will be student name say for example ,COMMA  Amith will be either a string or an array of character ,COMMA  department ,COMMA  somebody can say mechanical engineering that can also be a character string ,COMMA  whereas ,COMMA  roll number 748 will be an integer and CGPA say 7 .PERIOD 8 will be a floating point number .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what we can see that in order to store the student data we have to have a mixture of different data types .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a structure allows us to do exactly this where I can consider this student data as a structure .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let me redraw it in a different way .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I draw a box which is representing the student data .PERIOD  I name it stud data and I have got
different fields in this .PERIOD  Each field has gotten some identification .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this field is storing the name
and this field is basically of a type character array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  another field is name is department and its type is also character array ,COMMA  another field  ;SEMICOLON  remember that I every time I am using that term field of student data .PERIOD 

So name ,COMMA  department ,COMMA  what else do we have - role number which will be of type integer and
CGPA which will be float .PERIOD  Suppose there is no other field .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we call this entire box to be a
structure - this is a structure and what is contained in this structure ?QUESTIONMARK  There are 4 fields that define the structure - the 4 fields are name ,COMMA  department ,COMMA  roll number and CGPA ,COMMA  these 4 fields are defining a structure .PERIOD  Now C allows us to define structures of this type and we learn how we can define such things and let us go ahead a little bit ,COMMA  what is a structure ?QUESTIONMARK  It is a convenient tool for handling a group of logically related data items here .PERIOD 

Of course ,COMMA  the logically related data items were the different information fields or information
component that are related to a particular student .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  till now ,COMMA  we saw very simple data
structures like array .PERIOD  Now here for example ,COMMA  I have got related components - student name ,COMMA  roll
number and marks or CGPA or for example a real part and imaginary part of a complex number .PERIOD 

For example ,COMMA  if I had tried this ,COMMA  a complex number (all of you know that a complex number is
expressed as a plus ib) where x is a complex number a plus i b .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  maybe x is equal to 4 plus i 3 .PERIOD 
All of you are aware of that .PERIOD  Now how do I represent I know how could I can represent an
integer ,COMMA  I know ,COMMA  how I can represent a floating point number ,COMMA  but now the question is ;SEMICOLON  how I can
represent such a complex number ?QUESTIONMARK  Now well let me have a structure like this which will have 2
fields ,COMMA  one is the real part ,COMMA  there is a real part .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I call it the real part another part is the
imaginary part and I can store this number simply as 4 ,COMMA  3 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the imaginary part is 3 and the real part is 4 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the complex number instead of being an
integer or a float is essentially a structure .PERIOD  This is another very common and easy use of
structures .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  whenever I refer to this variable x which is of type complex ,COMMA  I will be referring to
this structure and neither at 4 or nor at 3 .PERIOD  I will be looking at this whole thing .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  it helps us in organising the complex data in a much more meaningful way .PERIOD  The
individual structure elements that I was talking of which i was mentioning as fields is also known
as members .PERIOD  Now you will also find other names of structures  .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  structures are sometimes
called records and each of these horizontal boxes that we are drawing are called fields of that
record or when we referred to it as structures we call each of those smaller boxes as members .PERIOD 

So the composition of a structure can be defined as follows .PERIOD  See in a structure I can put a tag ,COMMA 
now this is very important ;SEMICOLON  what is the tag that I am putting over here ?QUESTIONMARK 

Say for example ,COMMA  earlier I was talking of student data .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my tag could be stud data as I had
written .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have to write struct stud data and inside that I have got several members and what
where my members ?QUESTIONMARK  My member was name ,COMMA  my member was roll number ,COMMA  department and
CGPA .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I had 4 members .PERIOD  Now each of these were of different types that is something which
is very important to understand .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  struct is the required keyword I must write ,COMMA  this word -
struct .PERIOD  This ‘tag’ is the name of the structure like stud data .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is a structure .PERIOD  Just as we had
done for other variables we had done say int x float y ,COMMA  etcetera .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here also instead of int or float I have to say struct and what is struct ?QUESTIONMARK  That is defined .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
first of all I have to define the structure .PERIOD  Int and float are defined by default any c compiler will
understand what int or float is ,COMMA  but if I write struct ,COMMA  then by default the compiler will not
understand what the structure is because there can be different structure ,COMMA  one structure can be for
student names ,COMMA  one structure can be for book details - if I had thought of a book detail and
wanted to store that in a structure ,COMMA  what will be the components ?QUESTIONMARK  The members will be of course
the title of the book ,COMMA  the author of the book the publisher year of publication ,COMMA  the ISBN number ,COMMA 
etc .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  therefore ,COMMA  each of these members will again be of different types .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will be a
heterogeneous organisation just as it was with the student data .PERIOD  If I want to define books for
example ,COMMA  I would have to write struct book followed by the definition of the members .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is
equivalent to as if I am drawing a structure and its name is becoming - book and I am defining
what are the members of this structure .PERIOD  Let us move a little ahead .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  member 1 ,COMMA  member 2 ,COMMA  etcetera are individual member declarations .PERIOD  We will see more
examples of this .PERIOD  The individual members can be of different types and that is the beauty of
structure ,COMMA  the individual members can be ordinarily variables ,COMMA  pointers ,COMMA  arrays or other structures ,COMMA  it can even be other structure that is very important it can be some variable ,COMMA  just as name or it can be an array - say name was a character array or it can even be a structure .PERIOD  That means ,COMMA  I can have a structure within a structure .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is possible that I will have something like this .PERIOD 

One field of the structure is a character array ,COMMA  another field of the structure can be an integer
variable or another field of the structure can be a structure itself ,COMMA  it can be another structure
where there are more members inside ,COMMA  that is also possible  .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that is the beauty and the flexibility that we get from structures .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the member names
within a particular structure must be distinct from one another ,COMMA  we cannot put the same name to 2 different structures .PERIOD  Once a structure has been defined individual structure type variables can be declared as (we will see) struct tag variable one variable 2 variable n ,COMMA  I think ,COMMA  it will be much
more clearer ,COMMA  if we go through an example ,COMMA  let us look at this example A .PERIOD 

First I start with a structure definition - struct student and then I put just 2 parentheses to show
that there will be some members defined inside .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  how do I define the members ?QUESTIONMARK  I say that one member is name which is an array of
character .PERIOD  The next one is roll number which is an integer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  roll number is a variable .PERIOD  I said
that a structure can field can be variable or can be array or can be another structure .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here is an example where you have an array and a variable of type int again ,COMMA  total marks can be integer ,COMMA  data of birth can be character and sizes .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  data birth is again of type array character array because the date of birth can be say 10 Jan ,COMMA  2010 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  like that it can be a character array .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is how a structure is defined .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  I am now defining the variables ,COMMA  I have defined the
structures here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I know once the compiler reads this and finds that well I some definition of
some variable called student I know that that is a structure and what is the constituent of that
structure ?QUESTIONMARK  That will be these fields .PERIOD 

Now this is just a type - just as we had int float ,COMMA  etcetera or char those where data types .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  I
am saying that I have got a structure of type this where there are 4 fields ,COMMA  but the data has not yet been put .PERIOD  This is very important though ,COMMA  there are 4 fields ,COMMA  one field is name and I say that is an array of thirty characters and there is a role number roll which is an int ,COMMA  total marks is an integer and date of birth is an array ,COMMA  but you see that there are no data already put inside this array .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  we have name variables - a 1 ,COMMA  a 2 ,COMMA  a 3 are variables of type student structure and what is
that student structure this is a structure .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a 1 will just be a copy of this structure and a variable ,COMMA 
a 1 may have (if I take this) may have some name like amith here ,COMMA  roll number may be 560 and
total maybe 700 and date of birth can be something .PERIOD  That is one particular instance of this
particular structure that has been defined .PERIOD This part must be very clear to all of you .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I have defined 3 variables a 1 ,COMMA  a 2 and a 3 each of type ;SEMICOLON  what kind of type ?QUESTIONMARK  type structure
student .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  type is struct student .PERIOD  We have got these fields as its constituents ;SEMICOLON  so struct student tells us a new data type and these are the variables of the data type .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it is also possible to write it in a much more compact form like .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  struct tag and then i write
struct student and I declare char name 40 ,COMMA  int roll no ,COMMA  int total marks ,COMMA char date of birth 10 and
then I could have put the variables a 1 ,COMMA  a 2 ,COMMA  a 3 inside this note here ,COMMA  the semicolon is coming
here that is that is the end of the definition .PERIOD So ,COMMA  here I have done it in a much more compact form
compared to the earlier one .PERIOD  In this form of course ,COMMA  this tag is optional .PERIOD  (Refer Slide Time: 22:40)

So ,COMMA  what I mean is say I define once again let me give an example to you say a complex number
I can write that as struct complex and members are int(need not be always int) .PERIOD  So instead if I
want to store data of type say 4 .PERIOD 5 plus i 7 .PERIOD 2 ,COMMA  then I would need float real ;SEMICOLON  float imaginary and

that is the end of the structure and I can say struct complex x 1 ,COMMA  x 2 ,COMMA  this is one way of
representing structure .PERIOD 

What does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK  It means that I have first defined the structure called complex which will
have these 2 components and then I defined that x 1 and x 2 are 2 variables of type this complex .PERIOD 
If I do it in this way I have got an advantage that later on I can define some other variables also y1 y 2 over here or I can also define it as struct float real part .PERIOD 

So that you do not face confusion ,COMMA  let us float real part ;SEMICOLON  float imaginary part and then I can say x
1 ,COMMA  x 2 .PERIOD  Note that here ,COMMA  I have not written the thing complex ,COMMA  I have not written it .PERIOD I could have
written ,COMMA  it would not have affected me ,COMMA  in any adverse way ,COMMA  but it is not necessary to write it over
here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I write this how will the compiler interpret it ?QUESTIONMARK Always you should think when
compiler looks at it what will it think what would it possibly do ?QUESTIONMARK 

So ,COMMA  the compiler is trying to understand ok now there is no ambiguity because it knows that x 1
and x 2 are 2 variables of type structure and the structure is defined here itself .PERIOD  I need not give
any name ,COMMA  but the advantage of giving a name is say I give the name complex here .PERIOD  Here I have
defined x 1 and x 2 ,COMMA  if I had done it in this way I could have later on ,COMMA  down the line in this
program ,COMMA  have written struct complex say y 1 z 1( its possible ,COMMA  because I have already defined
struct complex ) .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  there is a choice over here which you can think of let us go ahead a little bit .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in this case
the tag is optional .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is an example we will conclude this lecture with this example .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  struct student
character name thirty ;SEMICOLON  int roll number ;SEMICOLON  int total marks ;SEMICOLON  character data birth 10 ,COMMA  a 1 ,COMMA  a 2 ,COMMA  a 3 ;SEMICOLON  that
means ,COMMA  a 1 ,COMMA  a 2 and a 3 are 3 students ,COMMA  3 pieces of student information or I could have done it in
the way I have just now shown ,COMMA  the same thing without giving any tag over here ,COMMA  these are
equivalent .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  next lecture ,COMMA  we will talk about how do you process a structure that will come in the next
lecture .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  in the last lecture we had seen how a structure is defined .PERIOD  Now we will see more examples of that in this course .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  today we will be concentrating on how a particular structure can be
processed .PERIOD  In order to process a structure ,COMMA  we can we have to process every field of the structure .PERIOD 
We can operate on every field of the structure .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we can see that a structure how can we access the member of a structure .PERIOD  Say for example ,COMMA 
there is a variable like name .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we can say overalls name of the structure is say student all
right ;SEMICOLON  and in the inside student we have got name ,COMMA  roll number etcetera now I can .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my
variable is say all right let me say I have defined like this struct student ,COMMA  then all these then the
variables are a 1 ,COMMA  a 2 ,COMMA  a 3 I am sure you are getting confused a little bit .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  let us define it in the proper way as we are done in the last class .PERIOD  Suppose I define struct
student ,COMMA  char name 10 ,COMMA  int roll number all right suppose only two fields are there and I also say
that the variable is variables are x 1 comma x 2 these are 2 variables of the type of this structure
whose name is student .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is my variable named ?QUESTIONMARK  x 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here I can say x 1 x 1 dot this is the dot operator which tells about the member ,COMMA  now which member say I want to get the roll
number .PERIOD  x 1 dot roll number assign 720 all right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is how I can get access to a particular
member of a particular structure .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can also similarly write x 2 dot name .PERIOD 

Because that members name is name right name 3 is j all right because name has got a 10 field
character ok .PERIOD  I could have written x 2 dot name and I could have assigned a string to this all these are possible .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if this is clear then we go ahead a little bit were variable refers this variable is referring to is
referring to the name of a structure type variable and member is the referring to the field or the
particular member element ok .PERIOD  The examples are a 1 dot name ,COMMA  a 1 dot roll number ,COMMA  a 3 dot date of birth etcetera .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now here let us take the old example that we had seen that is a complex number and how we
can perform complex number addition .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  just to refresh your mind say I have I have got two
complex numbers x and y and I want to perform x plus y .PERIOD  Suppose x is a plus i b and y is m plus in then x plus y is the real parts are added separately .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is a plus m plus i then the imaginary
parts are added separately ,COMMA  b plus n that we know from our school level knowledge .PERIOD 

Now how can I perform this addition using the concept of a structure .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here you see in the
program ,COMMA  we define a structure called complex and there are three variables a ,COMMA  b and c of this
structure type of type complex all right .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  what are ?QUESTIONMARK  There that components are one is float
sorry I am sorry one is real part ,COMMA  another is I should rename this is actually the imaginary part its
renamed in this way here in this program it would have been better ,COMMA  if we I had written float real
part float imaginary part however .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  scan f I am reading the two numbers a is a variable ,COMMA  a is real part is being read and a is
complex part is being read note the format statements because both of them are float we are
putting percentage f all right .PERIOD  And so ,COMMA  I read a .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you see normally I would have just done scan f amperes and a ,COMMA  but here I have to do separately I have to read the real part and the imaginary
part ,COMMA  then the sum is being stored in c .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  c is real will be c is the sum .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is real will be sorry it is a real part will be the real part of
a plus the real part of b and the imaginary part or the as it is written here complex part is the
complex part of imaginary part of a plus the imaginary part of b .PERIOD  Then I am printing look at how
I am printing it ,COMMA  printing percentage f the real part of c and plus then I put j and then the complex
part of c .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what is being done is suppose I have got 2 numbers ,COMMA  3 .PERIOD 4 plus here I am using j some people I usually use i or j whatever you do ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  you write 7 .PERIOD 2 that is a is real part is this ,COMMA  and b is real part is say 4 .PERIOD 6 plus j 3 .PERIOD 8 now if I add them c will be these real parts are being added .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is 8 .PERIOD 0 plus the imaginary part is added that is 11 j 11 all right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will be printed is 8 plus j then the complex part 7 .PERIOD 0 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is a I think this is clear to you this not very difficult to understand let us move ahead .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you have seen here ,COMMA  if you note here you have got the structure definition specified and here are the very variable definitions .PERIOD  And here we are doing the reading and adding them part by part how am I accessing the members .PERIOD  I am accessing the members using this dot operator and
whenever I am reading the member I am actually reading the members ,COMMA  I am not reading the
structure as a whole .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  one thing to note is when I am declaring this structure inside the main ,COMMA  then the scope of
these variables real and complex etcetera or this structure as such is its scope is within the main .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if a structure is defined within a function ,COMMA  then as we exit that function the life of that
particular structure will end at that point .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  there are some things which we can do in a much more simpler way ,COMMA  you remember that in
the case of arrays we could not compare arrays together .PERIOD  That array a 1 is equal to a 2 that was
not possible ,COMMA  if we had to compare the array I had to check them element by element .PERIOD  On the
other hand in the case of a structure ,COMMA  a structure variable can be directly assigned to another
structure variable of the same type .PERIOD  For example ,COMMA  here if a is a structure ,COMMA  then I can assign another
structure b to it directly .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  all the elements if they are of course ,COMMA  of the same type ;SEMICOLON  So ,COMMA  here is one structure ,COMMA  here is
another structure now if I do this operation  ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  assignment then this will be copied
here ,COMMA  this will be copied here ,COMMA  this will be copied here ,COMMA  this will be copied here all right .PERIOD 

But if a and b where arrays in that case ,COMMA  that would not have been possible that a is an array and b is an array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the elements just by assigning a assign b ,COMMA  I could not assign these b elements to a that is not allowed in the case of an array ;SEMICOLON  however ,COMMA  that is possible in the case of a structure .PERIOD 

Secondly now here one important thing is that they must be of the same type all right otherwise
of course ,COMMA  the members and the fields will not match .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  a 1 assigned a 2 I can do ,COMMA  all the individual members get assigned .PERIOD  Two structure variables
cannot be compared for equality or inequality .PERIOD  Now this is important that two structure variables
I cannot compare them ,COMMA  that structure a 1 whether that is equal to a 2 that will have to do
compare I mean ,COMMA  what I said just a couple of minutes back was inadvertent that is wrong .PERIOD 

Structures we cannot compare we can assign in a short ,COMMA  but comparison of structures we cannot do as a whole all right .PERIOD  Two structure variables cannot be compared for equality or inequality now for that ,COMMA  what we have to do we can write a simple function say I can write and you can take it as an assignment ,COMMA  that we can write struct comp ,COMMA  struct c m p where you will take 2 structures as input and we will compare them and how do you compare them ?QUESTIONMARK  We will do say variable a 1 dot member 1 equals to is whether its if it is equal to variable a 2 dot member 1 ,COMMA  in that way if you do then it is possible .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what we can do here is ,COMMA  I have got two structures and there are 2 variables of the same type
of the same structure type one is a 1 and one is a 2 and I have got some values here all right .PERIOD  And say this is member 1 ,COMMA  member 2 ,COMMA  member 3 member 4 like that now in order to compare if I want to compare them what I have to do ?QUESTIONMARK  .PERIOD 

I will have to see if this is a 1 ,COMMA  a 1 dot m 1 is this also m 1 is equal to a 2 dot m 1 and a 1 dot m 2
is equal to a 2 dot m 2 and so and so forth .PERIOD  If I do then return 1 that could be my function  ;SEMICOLON  that
means ,COMMA  if all these are matching ,COMMA  then only I will say that they have been compared to be the
same otherwise it will return false .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here other else return false .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you have to write it nicely
you can take it up take it up as an assignment arrays of structures .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  once we know this ,COMMA  we can now make an array of structure why is that useful let us take
one problem .PERIOD  Let us say that I am trying to store the information of a class of students .PERIOD 

Where maybe there are say 40 students and their information about each student has got different components ;SEMICOLON  name in a particular class ,COMMA  roll number and say marks total marks .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  marks is an integer let me say ,COMMA  roll number is also an integer and name is a character array something all right .PERIOD  Now that so ,COMMA  this box this can be also depicted as a box having three fields name ,COMMA  roll number and marks ,COMMA  but I want to have that for all the 40 students .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I will have 40 such small boxes ,COMMA  each having 3 fields one after another .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that can be
represented as an array you know that in an array we can store data of only the same type .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
that is not causing any problem here ,COMMA  because each of these boxes are of the type struct students therefore ,COMMA  I can very well consider them to be an array of such structures .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if I call this class is this array ,COMMA  then each of these boxes are an element of that array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I
say class 0 ,COMMA  which element am I looking at ?QUESTIONMARK  This element right ;SEMICOLON  if I take class 0 dot name ,COMMA  then
which field am I looking at ?QUESTIONMARK  This particular field ;SEMICOLON  if I write class 2 dot roll number ,COMMA  which field
am I looking at ?QUESTIONMARK  Class 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is an array 0 1 2 you know that just in c any array starts with 0 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  0 1 2 I come over here and which field am I looking at roll number roll number is the second
field .PERIOD  In that way I can access each element of this array ,COMMA  either as a structure or as an individual
member of that structure all right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  in such cases or the same thing could be applicable ,COMMA  if I want to represent a library .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in that case what will happen ?QUESTIONMARK  A library will consist of books right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  suppose it is a small library ,COMMA 
where I have got a library of 20 books all right 20 books .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  books is an array of type what or let me let me name it different way .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am say in my
library is consisting of 20 books at most ,COMMA  and what is the type of library when we write in a
array ?QUESTIONMARK  We write int a 20 float a 20 like that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here what is the type of library ?QUESTIONMARK  Type of library
will be struct book .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  because every element of this library ,COMMA  when I write int a 20 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I
am talking of an array where there are 20 elements and each element is of type int .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  when I am talking of this struct book library 20 what will that mean ?QUESTIONMARK  That will mean that
here is an array library having 20 such field 20 such positions elements and each element is a
structure called book .PERIOD  I have not defined here the structure of book .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I should have done it
earlier .PERIOD 

Suppose I do here struct book ,COMMA  char name 10 semicolon that is the name of the book .PERIOD  Char author 10 the author of the book int ISBN and I close that .PERIOD  Suppose this is a structure of the book having 3 fields only I have it could have been more fields number of pages year of publication etcetera I am not showing that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  each of these elements have got 3 fields here name which is itself an array of 10 characters ,COMMA  author which is itself an array of 10 characters and an integer ISBN number .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is the whole element ,COMMA  the first or 1 element of the array library .PERIOD  And library is an array
which houses 20 at the most such individual structures .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I say library 3 dot ISBN where am
I going which one I am referring to ?QUESTIONMARK  0 ,COMMA  1 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3 library 3 and the last element of that this is the
ISBN number because this is a last one all right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  therefore ,COMMA  using structure allows us to store different types of data together ,COMMA  and again array
of structure is a very powerful facility that has been given to us ,COMMA  using which we can store many
more things and we get much more flexibility .PERIOD  Let us go here ,COMMA  once a structure has been defined
like the structure book that was defined we can declared an array of structures ,COMMA  for example ,COMMA 
struct student class 50 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  note here that class is an array having 50 elements .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is something like this here is class with 50 elements 0 to 49 ,COMMA  and what is each element ?QUESTIONMARK  Each of these elements is a structure of type student must have been defined somewhere earlier .PERIOD 

The individual members can be accessed by class whichever element are you want to have say
for example ,COMMA  struct student ,COMMA  one field is int roll number ,COMMA  there is a name ,COMMA  there is marks and
character .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is the student and I have got 3 variables a 1 ,COMMA  a 2 ,COMMA  a 3 .PERIOD  The array element within the structure and I have defined an array earlier that is a class of 50 right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  I have got an array of which every element is a structure like this ,COMMA  and the structures are variables a 1 ,COMMA  these are also the student variables also my class is consisting of the same structure .PERIOD 

The array element within the structure can be accessed as now you can very easily guess ,COMMA  if a 1
dot marks 2 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  here this example is telling us something more ,COMMA  here this example is showing
that any element of have and a member of this structure student can also be an array ,COMMA  that we had defined earlier this is also an array .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  suppose I have got this student a 1 his name is a ,COMMA  roll number is say 1 ,COMMA  and marks is itself
an array where the marks of literature ,COMMA  history geography ,COMMA  maths ,COMMA  science everything is stored and the date of birth is a character array all right .PERIOD  Now so ,COMMA  it is say 07 07 2007 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is a character array .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  when I am saying a 1 marks 2 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I am going to this field is the marks field ,COMMA  I am
going to the a 1 structure a 1 variable ,COMMA  and I am taking its structure and coming to the marks field or membership member and I am coming to the element 0 1 2 this particular element this
particular element I am coming to by this ,COMMA  this you must understand .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I can have an array within a structure ,COMMA  also I can have an array of structure .PERIOD  Till now what we
are discussing was and here what we discussed was an array of structure right .PERIOD  And here what we have just now shown you is what we have just now shown you is an example of that an array can also be a part of a structure .PERIOD 

Next lecture we will be talking about a new thing that is that is also very important type def .PERIOD  That
is very much useful for that facilitates us to create new type definitions and we can write much
simpler programs with this we will take it up in the next lecture .PERIOD 

We were discussing about structures and in particular we have discussed about the way the
structure is formed and in that context we have seen that a structure can contain within itself
some members which can also be a structure themselves .PERIOD 

For example ,COMMA  this one member which can itself be a structure consisting of other members .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
this is a structure struct S in which there is another struct say P which is a member of this ,COMMA  also
some member can be an array .PERIOD  This can be say name 10 char ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  it is a character array of name 10 ,COMMA  similarly it could be some member like int marks 20 .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  we have seen that we can have arrays within structure also in the last lecture we have
talked about arrays of structure .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  there is a scope of confusion between these two that is why I want to make it clearer that there can be an array within a structure as a member .PERIOD 

So the other thing is we can have an array of structure .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in this case we have got an array ,COMMA 
every element of that array is a structure of a particular type .PERIOD  We know that an array can hold
data elements of the same type .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I have one particular structure defined like say student ,COMMA  it
can be an array of students .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  each of them is of the type student .PERIOD So ,COMMA  these two must be
differentiated very clearly all right .PERIOD  

So ,COMMA  as you can see that here a structure member can be an array ,COMMA  we saw it in the last class last
lecture that say for example ,COMMA  a structure student has got an array char ,COMMA  character array name
thirty ,COMMA  all right ,COMMA  this is a part of an array .PERIOD  Now we know arrays within structure and we have also
seen arrays of structure ,COMMA  where we can have a number of elements of that particular structure .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here we have seen that we have got a an array class ,COMMA  the array is class which can hold up to 50 elements and each element of this class is a structure of type student .PERIOD 

When I come to say class i ,COMMA  then I am actually accessing a structure a particular structure in that
array .PERIOD  Now that structure has got number of fields therefore ,COMMA  if I have class i dot name ,COMMA  then I will
get a particular name (if that be the field) or I can say class 2 dot roll number .PERIOD 

So here there is an array of structures and we can handle them just as in this case where the index is pointing to the particular element ,COMMA  and then by dot operator we are going inside that element and looking at that array .PERIOD 

Whereas in the case of an array within a structure we look at that in a different way ,COMMA  suppose if I
come to the structure ;SEMICOLON  student and suppose there is a variable of variable of name say a 1 as of
type student ,COMMA  then I can say a 1 dot name and I can take a particular character of that .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  look at the difference of this ,COMMA  this is one and the other one was class i dot name j .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here I
am accessing the particular element from that structure ,COMMA  and here I am coming to the structure
and going to that array element within that structure .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is an usual point of confusion
among many students that is why I was repeating this .PERIOD 

Next we will start looking at an important style of writing programs which is typedef .PERIOD 

That facilitates our programming with structure .PERIOD  As the name typedef implies ,COMMA  we are defining
some type .PERIOD  We know that int is a type ,COMMA  float is a type ,COMMA  data type char is a type etcetera .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  I can also define my own type which I will be using in my program using this typedef command .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we may define a structured data type using a typedef command like this ,COMMA  let us see the
syntax .PERIOD 

The syntax is I say typedef struct member variable 1 member variable 2 member variable n and
then some tag .PERIOD  Tag is the name of the new data type .PERIOD  Let me illustrate this by differentiating this
with the earlier thing .PERIOD  Earlier we had written something like this struct student .PERIOD 

Then char name 10 int roll number .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I was defining a structure in this way ,COMMA  and I was later on
referring to the structure as struct student say student 1 ,COMMA  student 2 ,COMMA  in this way .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  what I am
trying to do here is ,COMMA  I am trying to define a type ,COMMA  suppose I do not write this ,COMMA  what I am doing
instead I am saying typedef struct same thing char name 10 ,COMMA  int roll number and naming this type
as student .PERIOD  If I do this then next time when I declare the student 1 and student 2 ,COMMA  I will do it in a
different way I can do it much simply .PERIOD  See how I am writing now ,COMMA  in the red box .PERIOD 

If I just simply write student ,COMMA  student 1 comma student 2 that is sufficient .PERIOD  Compare this with the
way we had declared int x float y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here int and float were some types ,COMMA  now here student 1
student 2 are two variables of type student .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  this type is not a default type it is not pre-

defined in c but I can use it because I have been already using this typedef statement has defined the structure as student .PERIOD 

But please differentiate between this and the normal definition of the student as we do normally .PERIOD 
Say struct something and then I say student .PERIOD  I say struct (we have seen this) and I write the
members here and then define that structure as the type student .PERIOD  Now this is a definition for a
particular structure as student .PERIOD  Now this ,COMMA  if I have to use it then I have to say struct student
followed by a 1 a 2 ,COMMA  student 1 student 2 whatever .PERIOD  But in this case if I do this typedef ,COMMA  I am saved from this problem .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us have a little look at how we will go about it .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that is a tag .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here typedef a particular structure ,COMMA  just like here it could be char name or int ,COMMA  roll ;SEMICOLON  note the semicolon at the end of if all this declarations ,COMMA  ultimately I name this tag semi say for example ,COMMA  here as student .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  tag is the name of the new data type .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  given that here is an example of complex number .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we are defining a type called complex ,COMMA  ignore this .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  typedef something having real part and an imaginary part is known as a data type complex
and then I am saying complex a b c just like int a b c ,COMMA  float a b c ,COMMA  I can write complex a b c
because complex has already been defined here .PERIOD 

Because complex has already been defined ;SEMICOLON  so ,COMMA  I think this is clear right  ?QUESTIONMARK 

Next we move to ,COMMA  how do we initialise a structure  ?QUESTIONMARK  We saw that we can initialise an array
similarly we can initialise a structure as well .PERIOD  Say a structure variables may be initialised
following similar rules like an array .PERIOD  The values are provided in a within the second braces
separated by commas for example ,COMMA  here complex a .PERIOD 

Complex a ,COMMA  is a complex variable 1 .PERIOD 0 comma 2 .PERIOD 0 what does it imply ?QUESTIONMARK  It implies that ‘a’ is a
structure having two fields and one field is 1 .PERIOD 0 another is 2 .PERIOD 0 .PERIOD  Similarly b is another field ,COMMA  which
is initialised to minus 3 .PERIOD 0 and 4 .PERIOD 0 .PERIOD  Just as we did it in the case of arrays ,COMMA  we do it for individual
structural variables here ,COMMA  but you have to put all the values initial values for all the fields of the
array .PERIOD (Refer Slide Time: 16:12)

So ,COMMA  this is what happens through this initialisation .PERIOD 

The last thing that we will be talking about is parameter passing in a function .PERIOD  How do we pass a
structure as a parameter to a function ?QUESTIONMARK  We have seen how arrays can be passed similarly how can we pass structures to a function like any other variable  ?QUESTIONMARK  Just like any other variable we can pass it like for example ,COMMA  here you can see that there is a swap between complex variable a and
complex variable b .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  a and b are both structures .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am saying just as we use to write void swap int a int b just like that ,COMMA  here I write complex a complex b .PERIOD  It is also a call by value .PERIOD  Now so ,COMMA  here is again the typical assignment .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is an example program using typedef .PERIOD  What is being done here is I am defining a type
complex ,COMMA  typedef struct - they are two parts real and imaginary and this data type is known as
complex .PERIOD  Now I am writing a function swap  .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am taking another variable which is of type
complex ,COMMA  tmp is of type complex .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  when I do assign a to tmp ,COMMA  then this tmp variable which is
of type complex will copy the variables (say here it was 3 .PERIOD 0 and minus 2) so ,COMMA  this will come here
it will become 3 .PERIOD 0 and this will become minus 2 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that is tmp .PERIOD  Now I copy b to a .PERIOD  I am sorry not this one ,COMMA  there was some b and the values of b
are copied to a  ,COMMA  not here ,COMMA  these are copied here and here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it might be that this is changed to 5 ,COMMA  this is changed to minus 2 .PERIOD 5 and then I copy tmp to b .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is again copied back .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  member by member the copy is done .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here we illustrate what you mean by typedef and a function that is using it .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now suppose how can we print a structure ?QUESTIONMARK  Say here is a function ,COMMA  the main function is
calling print x and print y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  say for example ,COMMA  my main function is initialising (now you
understand all this things) x to 4 ,COMMA  x real part to 4 ,COMMA imaginary part to 5 right and y’s real part to 10
and imaginary part to 15 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  I am calling print x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is calling print x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x is being
copied call by value to another local variable a ,COMMA  which is local to this function print .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a is
holding the complex variable x and print f a dot real a dot imaginary .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  field by field I print them .PERIOD  Then I come back I print y .PERIOD  Y is copied to a and the same thing
happens ,COMMA  then I call swap .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  swap as a function that we just now saw where we take tmp and we copy it to tmp ,COMMA  and then I copy b to a ,COMMA  and then tmp to a in that way we carry out the
swapping .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it is purely call by value and then I print x and print y .PERIOD  After I swap ,COMMA  what will happen in this
case ?QUESTIONMARK  If I go back to this case ,COMMA  where I am passing among this a and b ,COMMA  the x and y are being
swapped inside that function ,COMMA  but will that be swapped in actuality ?QUESTIONMARK  You check that yourself .PERIOD 

How do we return a structure from a function ?QUESTIONMARK  Suppose I have done something ,COMMA  but in this earlier case where x and y were being swapped inside the function ,COMMA  but when I come back to the main my x ,COMMA  y remains the same .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if we if we want to return the function for example ,COMMA  here ,COMMA  I carry out a real plus b real (I make it tmp) .PERIOD  So here is an example of adding two complex numbers ,COMMA  here complex a and complex b are two variables which have been passed on as parameter here ,COMMA  and I have got a tmp as a local function ,COMMA  a local variable .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  tmp dot real is copping a dot real plus b dot real .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is happening ?QUESTIONMARK  Here I have got
structure a with a real part and an imaginary part .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  3 .PERIOD 0 4 .PERIOD 2 another is b which is 2 .PERIOD 5 and may
be 3 .PERIOD 6 .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  when I am adding two complex numbers ,COMMA  you remember we discussed it in last class also ,COMMA  I first add this two .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a real is added to b real .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is tmp where I am getting 5 .PERIOD 5 and then
imaginary I am getting 7 .PERIOD 8 and now I return tmp .PERIOD 

Now in the main function if I had written something like say x and y were two complex
variables ,COMMA  and what I did was I added x y assigned to some other complex variable z ,COMMA  in that case

this tmp will be assigned to this complex variable z ,COMMA  that is how we can return a structure from a
Function .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  structure facilitates us in many ways but direct arithmetic operations are not possible with
structure variables ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I cannot just add a and b when both of them are structures .PERIOD  I have to do the arithmetic operations over its members .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  with that we conclude our discussion on structures and you will be given assignments on structures ,COMMA  and this will enable you to write
different types of handle different types of data types together and using the typedef ,COMMA  you can
design your own complex data type which you can utilise further .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  please practice using structures it is not at all difficult ,COMMA  only a little practice and a little
understanding is required .PERIOD 

Thank you .PERIOD 

In today’s lecture we will look at very important concept of programming ,COMMA  it is required to
conceptualise and understand this thing very well so ,COMMA  that you can have more flexibility with
programming .PERIOD  We have visited this idea the concept of pointers ,COMMA  earlier in the context of our
discussions of call by value and call by reference .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if you recall at that time ,COMMA  we had we had talked about the variables ,COMMA  which are in the memory
right  ?QUESTIONMARK 

So ,COMMA  suppose I am talking of a variable - x y z is the name of a variable .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that variable has got
some address ,COMMA  that address maybe say 5000 in the memory and who has allocated this address ?QUESTIONMARK 
That address has been allocated by the compiler .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  if I have another memory location ,COMMA  say a part of this which I am just drawing separately
whose address is say 7000 ?QUESTIONMARK  Say this one - 7000 and inside this location 7000 as it’s content ,COMMA  I
write 5000 and I say that whatever is the content of this location 7000 that is the variable I am
interested in .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  can I say that if I now give a symbolic name p to this 7000 or say this is p ,COMMA  that this p is
pointing to x y z because p is containing the address of x y z .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  p is a pointer to a
variable x y z .PERIOD  Right now p is pointing to x y z ,COMMA  but if I just change the value of this location
7000 and make it say 6000 then it will probably point to some other location here .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  p is therefore ,COMMA  a pointer variable ,COMMA  but when I say that it is a pointer variable ,COMMA  then it is not
pointing to any particular data ,COMMA  it can point to a type of data .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  instead of making this statement that p is a pointer variable to a variable x y z .PERIOD  Say this one is p q r now as I change this ,COMMA  now p is a pointer variable to a variable p q r .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if I generalis it lets say that in this situation where I have got x y z at 5000 and p q r at 6000
and 7000 is a pointer p then I can say p is a pointer variable pointing (say x y z and p q r who are both integers) to an integer or it could be a float or it could be a some other data type .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  pointed to a particular data type .PERIOD  Why I specify the data type will be clear in some time from now .PERIOD  The most important concept here is that p is a pointer ,COMMA  p is a variable and variable is holding some value and that value is nothing ,COMMA  but an address of another variable all right address of another variable .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now let us look at this the basic concept ,COMMA  every stored data items occupies one or more
memory cells ,COMMA  whenever we declare a variable the system allocates memory locations to that
variable ,COMMA  we know that very well ;SEMICOLON  so ,COMMA  need not spend more time on that .PERIOD  Now this is important ,COMMA 
you already know that the number of memory cells required to store a data item depends on its
type ,COMMA  typically for char we need one byte ,COMMA  for int we need two bytes ,COMMA  for float we need four bytes
etcetera .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  since every byte in memory has an unique address ,COMMA  this location will also have its unique
address .PERIOD  Every element will have a unique address .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  let us see here the same example ,COMMA  consider the statement int x y z assigned 50 .PERIOD  This statement means that the compiler will allocate for this x y z some location and put the value 50 in that location .PERIOD  Suppose the address of x y z is 1380 .PERIOD  Here x y z is a variable and 50 is the value and
1380 is the address of that variable we know that ,COMMA  we have discussed it earlier .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  during execution of the program ,COMMA  when the program is being executed the system always
associates the name x y z with the address 1380 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  whenever in the program we find x y z ,COMMA  the variable x y z being referred ,COMMA  it will go to the memory location thirteen eighty and fetch that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the value 50 can therefore ,COMMA  be accessed by going to the location 1380 and accessing it .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  the variables which are holding these addresses are known as the pointers .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  memory address is just numbers .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I can also store them in some variables and these variables which are for example ,COMMA  the
address of the variable that will hold the address of variable x y z is the pointer to x y z .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is
also naturally stored in some memory location .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is just the example that I was discussing right now .PERIOD  Suppose we assign the address of x y z to a variable p ,COMMA  then p is said to point to the variable x y z .PERIOD 

I was comfortably drawing this that there is 5000 here ,COMMA  x y z and 5000 here and I was simply
saying that this variable which was in location 7000 was pointing to this  ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  this was
being loaded with 5000 .PERIOD  How is that being done ?QUESTIONMARK  How is 5000 being written inside this location ?QUESTIONMARK 
The statement is just like any other assignment .PERIOD  It will be that these variables name is p ,COMMA  p is
assigned the address of x y z .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  p assigned and x y z .PERIOD 

Here we can see that the variable x y z is the address is 1380 value is 50 .PERIOD  P is a pointer variable
whose value is 1380 because it is pointing to x y z .PERIOD 

In our diagram that I was drawing by hand ,COMMA  this p was holding the value 5000 and its address
here is say 2545 ,COMMA  in my diagram it was 7000 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is a picture 1380 is the address of 50 and p which is located as 2545 is holding the address 1380 .PERIOD  Whenever you find difficulty in dealing
with pointers my suggestion to the student is to draw a piece of diagram and then make the
whole picture clear in front of you .PERIOD 

Now you know that if I put the operator and ,COMMA  ampersand immediately before the variable it will
return the address of the variable and x y z will give me the say the value 1380 ,COMMA  which is the
address of x y z .PERIOD 

The address of x y z is assigned .PERIOD  This operator ‘and’ can be used only with a simple variable or
with an array element .PERIOD  For example ‘and’ distance ,COMMA  ‘and’ x 0 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  the address of the first
location of the array x and of x i minus 2 .PERIOD 

Now what is illegal ?QUESTIONMARK  This is illegal ;SEMICOLON  the reason is obvious .PERIOD  Two thirty 5 is not a variable it is a
constant .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it does not have any fixed position in the memory .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is not a memory location therefore ,COMMA 
it does not have address so its meaningless .PERIOD  Pointing to a constant is not possible ,COMMA  I cannot say
and arr ,COMMA  because this shows that arr is a particular variable ,COMMA  but it is an array therefore I cannot
show it like this ,COMMA  it is just pointing at an array name ,COMMA  it is not pointing at the array .PERIOD 

We cannot also do this and a plus b - that is also not possible because(Refer Time: 12:19) if I
have a as some value and b has some value then I add them and it will be a value and a value
does not have any address ,COMMA  that is pointing at an expression .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is a quick example I think I had shown this to you earlier say I have got a number of
variables - one character ,COMMA  one double ,COMMA  floats .PERIOD  I am assigning some values to these ,COMMA  here I am
putting some values ,COMMA  and print f a particular variable ‘a’ is stored in the address anda b is stored
in address andb ,COMMA  c is stored in address andc so and so forth therefore ,COMMA  if we run it ,COMMA  we will get the addresses .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  10 is stored in location so and so ,COMMA  2 .PERIOD 5 is stored in location so and so ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK 

Now ,COMMA  here incidentally all these are contiguous locations ,COMMA  but they may not be contiguous
locations also .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  10 is stored in location ,COMMA  ‘a’ having the value 10 is stored in location so ,COMMA  and so like that it goes on .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  pointer declarations ,COMMA  when we declare some variable as a pointer ,COMMA  the typical ,COMMA  the standard
form is this .PERIOD  Data type shown in red (that is very important) and this star - this is something new
that you also saw when we were discussing call by reference ,COMMA  for example ,COMMA  int is a type star x y z x ,COMMA  what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK  It means that x is a pointer ,COMMA  which is enabled or which is allowed to point to variables of type integer .PERIOD  Only integers can be pointed to by x .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  similarly I could have said float star p  ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  p will be a pointer ,COMMA  that can only be
pointing to floating point numbers .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  three things are specified in this disk in this declaration .PERIOD 

One is that this star tells that the variable ,COMMA  pointer name or p whatever you call it ,COMMA  is a pointer
variable ,COMMA  not a normal variable and asterisk is telling that it is a pointer variable .PERIOD  Pointer name is
a variable therefore ,COMMA  it needs a memory location and pointer name points to a variable of the
specified data type .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these three things you must remember when you are handling with the
pointer .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is an example int star count what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK  That means ,COMMA  count is a pointer variable .PERIOD 
Why a pointer variable ?QUESTIONMARK  Because this is preceded with the star and where can this pointer
variable point to ?QUESTIONMARK  To all data type data variables of type integer .PERIOD  Speed is again a pointer because it has got this asterisk and where can speed point to ?QUESTIONMARK  Speed can point to variables of type float .PERIOD 
Once a pointer variable has been declared ,COMMA  it can be made to point to a variable using an
assignment statement like this - int star p x y z .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  int star p is a pointer variable ,COMMA  x y z is an integer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you see by the same declaration I have declared two things - one is a pointer to an integer and an integer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I make such an
assignment like p is assigned and x y z .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x y z is here and its location can be 5000 and p is a
pointer variable and so when I do this assignment ,COMMA  this might be in the location 7000 ,COMMA  but when I
do this what it does is it loads this 5000 here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  p is pointing to x y z .PERIOD  I hope it is clear
now .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is called pointer initialisation .PERIOD 

The things to remember is the pointer variables must always point to an item of the same type .PERIOD 
One pointer variable ,COMMA  either it points to an integer or it points to a float or it points to an array of
characters whatever it is .PERIOD 

Now so ,COMMA  here for example ,COMMA  this is an error ,COMMA  why it is this is an error ?QUESTIONMARK  X is of type floating point ,COMMA  x
is a variable and p is a pointer which is allowed to point to only integer ,COMMA  but here I have made an
assignment where I am assigning to p ,COMMA  the address of the floating point number - that is not
allowed .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  therefore ,COMMA  I am forcing p to point to x ,COMMA  but the type of p and the type of x are different .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
assigning an absolute address to a pointer is prohibited .PERIOD  You cannot do this ,COMMA  you cannot force a
pointer to a constant value ,COMMA  that you must keep in mind .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  how do I access a variable through a pointer ?QUESTIONMARK  Once a pointer has been assigned the address of a variable ,COMMA  the value of the variable can be accessed through the indirection operation .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us give an example first .PERIOD 

For example ,COMMA  a b are two integers .PERIOD  Let us draw this I am sorry ,COMMA  suppose a is a location ,COMMA  b is
another location ,COMMA  both of them are integers and p is a variable ,COMMA  which is allowed to point to

integers and what I do ?QUESTIONMARK  I assign to p the address of a .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the address of ‘a’ let us say is 1000 or 100 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  100 is written here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it comes here .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what did this statement do ?QUESTIONMARK  100 was the address of a ,COMMA  that has been assigned to p .PERIOD  Now what is being done by this ?QUESTIONMARK  B is being assigned star p ;SEMICOLON  b is getting the content of wherever p is
pointing .PERIOD  Suppose this was 50 ,COMMA  then b is getting 50 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  little bit of confusion can occur because
of these two star ps .PERIOD  Please understand that this star is just telling you that p is a pointer because it is coming in a declaration statement .PERIOD  On the other hand here it’s is not a declaration statement is an assignment statement .PERIOD  I have already declared p to be a pointer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  p is a pointer .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  once a pointer has been assigned the address of a variable ,COMMA  that is done in this step the value of the variable can be accessed using the indirection operation ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  which variable say I could have done p assigned b assigned a .PERIOD  Instead of doing that what I am saying is (just note my two English statements) one is the value of a is being assigned to b or b is being assigned the value of a this is statement number 1 ;SEMICOLON  statement number 2 is b is being assigned the value of the variable that is being pointed at by p  .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here one is b is assigned the value of a ;SEMICOLON  one statement .PERIOD  Here that is this statement .PERIOD  And this
statement is b is assigned the value (instead ‘of’ a ,COMMA  I am saying is being assigned the value) of the variable pointed by p .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is an indirect way of saying that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is something that you must very clearly
understand ,COMMA look at this once again .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I can now say that this thing is equivalent to b assigned a ,COMMA  but I have done that in a indirect
way .PERIOD 

If you have understood this then pointer should be clear to you ,COMMA  here lets look at one example
integer a b c assign 5 and p is a pointer to integers .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  in this statement what has been done ?QUESTIONMARK 

‘a’ has being assigned 4 times c plus 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  c is being added to 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is becoming 10 and 4
times 10 is 40 ,COMMA  40 is being assigned to a .PERIOD  Here what is being done ?QUESTIONMARK  P is being assigned ,COMMA  c is
address .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  wherever c was let’s say address 1000 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is being assigned to a variable p .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  p is becoming 1000 .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  b what is b being assigned ?QUESTIONMARK  b is being assigned 4 times star p plus 5 .PERIOD  What is star p ?QUESTIONMARK  Star p is nothing ,COMMA  but the variable c ,COMMA  it’s pointing to that and whatever was its value suppose it was 10 ,COMMA  it was sorry it was 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that value is being taken and 5 is being added to that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it becomes 10 times this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these two are essentially equivalent .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is another example ,COMMA  you have seen this example very similar to this that I am defining a
pointer ,COMMA  p t r is a pointer ,COMMA  x is 10 ,COMMA  you just think of what it should print ?QUESTIONMARK  X is 10 ,COMMA  p t r is the
address of x and y is being assigned star p t r ,COMMA  what does this mean ?QUESTIONMARK  P t r is pointing to 10 and y
is being assigned to star p t r ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  y is being assigned to 10 or rather I should say y is
being assigned x and x was 10 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  y is become becoming 10 .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  if I print ,COMMA  instead of x what will be printed ?QUESTIONMARK  Instead of x the ,COMMA  value of x will be printed .PERIOD 10 is
stored in the address this .PERIOD  Similarly now what is this ?QUESTIONMARK  ‘star and x’ - what does this mean ?QUESTIONMARK  ‘and x’
is the address of x and where that is pointing to - these two should be same .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if you look at if you look at the result - this is equivalent why ?QUESTIONMARK  ‘And x’ is the address of x
and star just like star p ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  the content of where the pointer is pointing to .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these two are same right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  ptr is ‘and x’ .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these two are all equivalent ok .PERIOD  If I say ‘and x’  ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I am taking the
address of star ptr .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is something you can play with yourself and you will get a printout like this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these
two are the same .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  here we are coming to something more which is known as pointer expressions and we will
deal with that in the next lecture .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we were discussing about pointers and we have seen that pointer is a variable .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is a
variable ,COMMA  but a variable that points to some other variable ,COMMA  but naturally the question that can arise is since pointers are variables so ,COMMA  you should be able to do some sort of operations like arithmetic operations on them .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the answer is yes we can do that and in today’s lecture we will look at exactly that - pointer expressions .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  this concept of pointers is a very strong component of the c language and it is not the case
that in all languages this pointer is there ,COMMA  but we are discussing pointers specifically ,COMMA  because it
will give you a very good idea about what indirection is .PERIOD  We had mentioned about indirection
right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  for example ,COMMA  I am just before moving into the actual discussion ,COMMA  let me come to this that -
what is an indirection  ?QUESTIONMARK 

Somebody asks you the address of toms house ,COMMA  you can do two things - you can either give him
the address of toms house or you can give him the address of johns house .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that he goes to
johns house and asks john to get the address of toms house .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I do not know toms address ,COMMA  but I
know john who knows toms address .PERIOD  This is indirection - one level of indirection .PERIOD 

Another level of indirection could be that (second level of indirection) .PERIOD  You can go to ram and
ram will know the address of john who knows the address of tom .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is second level of
indirection .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in our case we have got a particular variable p ,COMMA  let me just call this variable x ,COMMA 
and that x has got some value .PERIOD  I am not saying that x has also got an address .PERIOD 

But I am not saying what is the value of x ?QUESTIONMARK  What is x ?QUESTIONMARK  That is my question and instead of
answering that ,COMMA  I am giving you a pointer to x and I am asking that ok I tell you I will give you
the answer ,COMMA  go to p and find x right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  then p must be assigned the address of x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I go to this ,COMMA  then I come to p and get the value of x as I want to have that in some other variable v ,COMMA  where I want to have star p .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  indirectly I could have done simply - v assigned x .PERIOD  These two are equivalent ,COMMA  that is what we
discussed in the last class right .PERIOD  That is why it is an indirection that often comes in very handy ,COMMA 
very useful ,COMMA  when we carry out many computations .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  like other variables pointer variables can also be used in expressions .PERIOD  If p 1 and p 2 are two
pointers the following statements are valid - star p 1 plus star p 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is being meant by
that ?QUESTIONMARK  Suppose p 1 is pointing to something ,COMMA  where there is 50 and p 2 is pointing to something
which is stored as 60 - then what is sum ?QUESTIONMARK  Sum becomes 50 plus 60 ,COMMA  star p 1 plus star p 2 ,COMMA  50 plus 60 so ,COMMA  that should be 110 .PERIOD 

Next similarly ,COMMA  I can have this .PERIOD  But here it would be easier nicer to read ,COMMA  if I had put parentheses .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that I had not confused about this Asterix and this Asterix .PERIOD  These have got completely
different significances ,COMMA  this is a multiplication and this astrix is saying it is a content of a
particular pointer .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  similarly the these two are equivalent of course ,COMMA  I have already shown that .PERIOD  Now this is also
possible star p 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in my earlier drawing p 1 was 50 ,COMMA  50 plus 2 - that is coming over here .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA whenever you are finding difficulty as I suggested just draw a simple diagram ;SEMICOLON  p 1 is pointing
to some other variable which has got the value 40 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  star p 1 is what ?QUESTIONMARK  Star p 1 is that particular - variable x and plus 2 that is equivalent to x plus 2 which is 42 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this one is being modified to 42 .PERIOD 

Similarly ,COMMA  I can do other operations like this where you must understand that this is actually just
like another variable - an integer variable or whatever type of variable p1 is and it is simple .PERIOD  No
other complications in that .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  what are allowed in C ?QUESTIONMARK  There are certain things are allowed in C and some things are not
allowed in C ,COMMA  I can add an integer to a pointer ,COMMA  I can subtract an integer from a pointer ,COMMA  I can
subtract one pointer from another and say if p 1 and p 2 are both pointers to the same array ,COMMA  then p 2 minus p 1 gives the number of elements between p 1 and p 2 .PERIOD  For example ,COMMA  suppose here there is an array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  p 1 is pointing here and p 2 is pointing here .PERIOD  Then the number of elements p 2 minus p 1 will be just the subtraction of these addresses .PERIOD 

Suppose this was 500 ,COMMA  501 (if it is a character) 502 ,COMMA  503 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have got three elements in between
right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these are all allowed .PERIOD  I can subtract an integer from a pointer .PERIOD  I can add an integer to a
pointer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I add an integer to a pointer that is p 1 ,COMMA  p 1 plus 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that means it will point to
this point ,COMMA  this element .PERIOD  What are not allowed ?QUESTIONMARK  The things that are not allowed are you cannot
add two pointers .PERIOD 

The reason is obvious - p 1 is a pointer and p 2 is a pointer .PERIOD  Now these two are two different
locations .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  say p 1 is in location 7000 pointing to some variable ,COMMA  and p 2 is in location 10 ,COMMA 000
pointing to some other variable .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what does p 1 plus p 2 mean ?QUESTIONMARK  7 ,COMMA 000 plus 10 ,COMMA 000 - 17 ,COMMA 000 that does not mean anything .PERIOD  That can be a point to some garbage value or something else ;SEMICOLON  So ,COMMA  that is not allowed .PERIOD  Compiler will hold you for that ,COMMA  multiply or divide a pointer in an expression ,COMMA  that is also not allowed .PERIOD  You
cannot multiply ,COMMA  you can just add an integer ,COMMA  subtract an integer or subtract one pointer from
another ,COMMA  these three you can do .PERIOD 

Here is something which is known as a scale factor ,COMMA  let us see whether you understand this or
not .PERIOD  We have seen that an integer value can be added or subtracted .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here let us look at this ,COMMA  p 1 and p 2 are two pointers of type integer .PERIOD  I mean when p 1 is
pointing to an integer ,COMMA  p 2 is also pointing to an integer all right .PERIOD  Now i ,COMMA j are two integer
variables .PERIOD  p 1 is p 1 plus 1 so that means what ?QUESTIONMARK  p 1 was pointing somewhere ,COMMA  but I am just adding some constant to that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here is a memory location and say p 1 is pointing to this and suppose it is an integer so ,COMMA  this is pointing to an integer .PERIOD  Now p 1 plus one means this will point to the next integer .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  I am not saying that if an integer takes two bytes each of them are of two bytes .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it just
comes to the next integer .PERIOD  That is why the type is important .PERIOD  Depending on the type it is updating either by 2 or by 1 ,COMMA  but p 1 plus 1 means I am going to the next .PERIOD  p 2 is assigned ;SEMICOLON  p 1 plus j where j can be something .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  p 2 was pointing somewhere here ,COMMA  I am upgrading that with the j value ,COMMA  going to the j th next .PERIOD 
Similarly p 2 plus plus ,COMMA  p 2 assigned any arithmetic operation I can do all right .PERIOD 

In reality it is not the integer value which is added or subtracted ,COMMA  but rather the scale factor times
the value - that is one times the size of the integer if it were .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is j times the size of an
integer ,COMMA  2 bytes ,COMMA  4 bytes - that is what that is why it is called the scale factor .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is not this 1 ,COMMA  but one next ,COMMA  two next ,COMMA  here j th next ,COMMA  it is like that .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  for character the scale factor is 1 ,COMMA  integer is 4 ,COMMA  if 4 bytes take one integer ,COMMA  float 4 .PERIOD  Now this
could be 2 - that depends on what the scale factor is .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I write here for an integer pointer ,COMMA 
assuming the my computer is actually doing this - that each of them is 4 ,COMMA  then p 1 plus plus is
adding p 1 by 4 ,COMMA so it is going to the next integer .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  in between there are 4 bytes .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am going to the next integer .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  there is one quick way of finding out ,COMMA  how we can find out what is the representation in my
system ?QUESTIONMARK  There is a nice inbuilt function called size of .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I give size of int ,COMMA  the system returns
me the value 4 or 2 depending on how much ,COMMA  how many bytes does int consume .PERIOD 

Similarly ,COMMA  I could have given size of float - that will tell me how many bytes has a float
consumed so and so forth .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is one way to find the scale factors .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  number of bytes
occupied by float is size of float .PERIOD  If you give that the system will give you the number of bytes
required for that representation .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if in a system you would run this and you find that it is float is 4 ,COMMA  int is 4 then you know what
my scale factor is .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  just like and for every case we are thinking of how do we pass an array to a function ,COMMA  how
do we pass a structure to a function ,COMMA  here again we look at how do we pass a pointer to a
function .PERIOD  Pointers are often passed as parameters to a function and if you have thought about it
you must have already discovered .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  always it allows the data items ,COMMA  within the calling
programs to be accessed by the function ,COMMA  altered and then returned to the calling function in the
altered form ,COMMA  this says the calling by reference .PERIOD 

Normally arguments are passed to a function by value ,COMMA  we had discussed this .PERIOD  Now this is called
as call by reference or call by address ,COMMA  now you can see this - how this is done .PERIOD  Because in call
by value we have seen that in the swap function for example ,COMMA  it was swapped within the function ,COMMA  but that x y and the main functions x y were two different entities ,COMMA  therefore whatever change was there that was lost .PERIOD 

But if I had just passed on the pointer then whatever change I do in the pointer in that particular
location ,COMMA  I simply pass on the address and make a change over there ,COMMA  then the change is reflected because it is the same location that is known as call by reference .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  here is an example ,COMMA  you have seen this passing by value ,COMMA  I am repeating this - a was 5 and b was 20 ,COMMA  I call swap a b .PERIOD  Here ,COMMA  what happened  ?QUESTIONMARK  x was 5 ,COMMA  b was 20 .PERIOD  I changed it .PERIOD  Now x was 20 and b was 5 ,COMMA  but when I returned and printed this a and b they were completely different .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  swapping was not reflected .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  here x and y was swapped but a and b do not swap .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the output will be the same 5 and 20 .PERIOD 

But if I had done through reference ,COMMA  here you see how I pass it on .PERIOD  Here what I am passing you
have must have thought about it .PERIOD  Swap instead of sending that value ,COMMA  what I am sending is the
address of that ,COMMA  address of a and address of and here inside the function ,COMMA  what I am a what am I
accepting ?QUESTIONMARK  I am accepting the pointer .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here (x and y) I know that what is coming to me is a pointer .PERIOD  We discussed it earlier also ,COMMA  but
let me repeat because there is a very fundamental idea ,COMMA  a is 5 ,COMMA  b is 20 and now I swap .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here do I have x ?QUESTIONMARK  No .PERIOD  I have got this x which is nothing ,COMMA  but ‘and a’ and I have got this y which is
nothing ,COMMA  but ‘and b’ .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  therefore ,COMMA  they are pointing to these points .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  when I swap ,COMMA  I am actually swapping the content of x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the content of x  ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA 
here that is going to t and then content of y ,COMMA  indirection ,COMMA  I go from here ,COMMA  follow my cursor .PERIOD  I go
here and that one is going as the content of a ,COMMA  content of x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here it is becoming 20 and then t is coming as a content of y .PERIOD  What is y ?QUESTIONMARK  y is here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is coming as 5 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  when I come out and print here - a and b as you can see has changed .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you see how did I pass on the parameter ?QUESTIONMARK  Look at this - I have passed on the address and I have accepted them in my function as the pointer .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  with this we will get the correct answer x and y swap a and b also swap .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the answer is -
that is correct one as we expected .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now let us skip this a little bit and let us go to something
else as pointers and arrays .PERIOD 

When an array is declared ,COMMA  the compiler allocates a base address and sufficient amount of
storage .PERIOD  You know that when I declare something as an array ,COMMA  int a 10 and if I say that int ,COMMA I have
discovered using size of fact that int takes 4 bytes ,COMMA  then for every element 4 bytes are kept and 40 such locations are allocated for the array a .PERIOD 

Now when I refer to this array a ,COMMA  because we saw that we pass on an array by reference to a
function the reason behind that is that this name array a is the same as a pointer to the first
location of the array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is as if equivalent to a is a pointer that is pointing to the first location
of this array a .PERIOD They are equivalent .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the base address is a location of the first element of the array ,COMMA  the compiler also defines the
array name as a constant pointer to the first .PERIOD  When I declared it with the compiler it also keeps a
constant pointer ,COMMA  that pointer you cannot change ok .PERIOD 

 .PERIOD 

For example ,COMMA  when I say x 5 ,COMMA  1 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  4 ,COMMA  5 then suppose the base address is 2500 ,COMMA  each integer
requires 4 bytes ,COMMA  then the elements will be x 0 will be 2500 ,COMMA  x 1 will be 2504 so and so forth and
the pointer will be 2500 .PERIOD 

If we go up 2500 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  there is a pointer x - which means ‘and address of x 0’ ,COMMA  which is 2500  .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  p assigned x and p assigned ‘and of x 0 ;SEMICOLON  are equivalent .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we can access successive values of x by using p plus plus or p minus minus to move from one element to another .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I have got the p ,COMMA  I have got this pointer which is pointing to the array .PERIOD  I cannot change that
pointer ,COMMA  but if I do p plus plus - this pointing to the first element ,COMMA  then I go to the next element of
the array record by the scale factor .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is if I do p plus plus I am actually doing p plus 4 .PERIOD  In
that way I can move across .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the relationships should be clear here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  p plus 1 is the next one ,COMMA  p plus 2 is the next one -
that we have already explained .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is a function to find average ,COMMA  here you see we have got a main program ,COMMA  where I have
got an array ,COMMA 100 elements ,COMMA  for k 0 to n ,COMMA  I am reading k and then I am calling this average x .PERIOD  I am
calling average x n .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  here what goes in average x n ,COMMA  you have seen this ,COMMA  now I am passing
the pointer .PERIOD  When I am saying I am just passing the array actually I have passed on the pointer .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  whatever I did I am doing here .PERIOD  I am taking another star p ,COMMA  which is local which is pointing to
the array .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  my array was here and I am putting another pointer p which is pointing to this array and
array means what ?QUESTIONMARK  Array means the first location of the array .PERIOD  Then I carry on the sum here .PERIOD  I
carry on with p .PERIOD  Here you see what I do .PERIOD  I take p and then I change p .PERIOD  Sum assigns star p plus i .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  p plus 1 ,COMMA  p plus 2 ,COMMA  p plus3 and star p plus 1 ,COMMA  p plus 2 means the content of this ;SEMICOLON  these contents .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here in this way I am getting the sum and what do I return ?QUESTIONMARK  Return float sum by size .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I
get sum ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA  the array was integer ,COMMA  but now this is something called typecasting- although
it was float ,COMMA  I put it in a bracket .PERIOD  That means ,COMMA  whatever is coming here I am converting that to
float .PERIOD  Sum will be an array ,COMMA  sum of all integers will be an integer ,COMMA  but when I divide by that ,COMMA 
although I did not declare ‘sum’ to be ah a floating point number ,COMMA  just by this sort of type
typecasting .PERIOD 

I can make it a floating point number and then how do I return it ?QUESTIONMARK  Yes you might have guessed
correctly ,COMMA  that I do not need to return it because whatever I have done ,COMMA  here when I passed an

array ,COMMA  whatever was done that is being done here and what I am returning ?QUESTIONMARK  I am returning this to
the average .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will get this value all right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this should be clear .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  its clarified .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA next thing that I will be discussing a little bit is dynamic memory
allocation ,COMMA  I will take little time to explain that and that is a very important concept and after that
we will move to a some discussions ,COMMA  basic discussions on file .PERIOD 

We have seen how structures are represented ,COMMA  we have also learnt about pointers .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  today we will be looking at the structures once again in a different light .PERIOD  As you can see here ,COMMA  a structure can be declared as is shown here the student structure struct stud is consisting of three members or three fields .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  they are - the role ,COMMA  the department code which is a character array and cgpa which is a
floating point number and a b c are three variables of the type s t u d ,COMMA  stud .PERIOD  The individual
structure elements you now can be accessed by a dot role .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a is this field or b dot role c dot c g p a .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  with this dot operator we can access them .PERIOD  This was known to us right .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  we can also we have seen that ,COMMA  we can define an array of structures where class is an array of students ,COMMA  class size is 100 and each element is a structure of type stud .PERIOD  The structure elements of the individual records can be accessed with this dot operator like class i ,COMMA  any particular element of that ,COMMA  say for example ,COMMA  here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is class i where i is this index ,COMMA  I come over here ,COMMA  and get a particular field of this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this has got a number of fields .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am coming to the role field or the department code field dot the cgpa field .PERIOD  This was also known to us .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here we are trying to apply that to an example sorting by roll numbers .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here we have got
a set of students ,COMMA  look at the declaration here .PERIOD  Struct stud is the structure ,COMMA  having role department code and cgpa .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  in the main function what are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK  We are defining struct student class 100 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  struct start has been declared ,COMMA  it has been declared globally ,COMMA  even before main that is possible .PERIOD 

Here I am saying that class 100 is one array and t and there are some integers .PERIOD  ’t’ is again a
structure ,COMMA  t is also a structure of type stud .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  I am reading the number of students ,COMMA  how many
students are there in the class .PERIOD  The array can accommodate at most 100 but I am reading the
value n .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  for each of the elements ,COMMA  (look at this is our familiar for loop here) for k 0 to less
n ,COMMA  I am scanning the class ,COMMA  the roll number of that particular student ,COMMA  the department code and the c g p .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  in that way I read here .PERIOD  I am reading the array all right .PERIOD  The array is being read here at this
point right .PERIOD  Now what I am doing now ?QUESTIONMARK  Next let us look at this loop .PERIOD  What are you doing here ?QUESTIONMARK 
For some value of j ,COMMA  if the role of that student ;SEMICOLON  so ,COMMA  here I have got my array ,COMMA  I am coming to j ,COMMA  a
particular element and looking at the role number field ,COMMA  if that is greater than some other value k ,COMMA 
if it is greater than the roll value of k ,COMMA  then I am exchanging them ,COMMA  just as we sort .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  what are we sorting here in that example earlier that we had done ,COMMA  we are sorting integers
or sorting real numbers .PERIOD  Here what we are doing we are sorting the entire structure ,COMMA  as you can
see the j is coming to t .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  t is again a structure .PERIOD  k is coming to j and so ,COMMA  this is a swap operation ,COMMA  swapping structures .PERIOD  It is called swapping the structures and this I am doing for k which is a internal variable and j is the
external variable .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my diagram should be a little different .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  for every j I am looking at one j and I am varying k from here .PERIOD  This is k .PERIOD  k is varying from
this point to this point to the end of the structure and comparing with this j value .PERIOD  If this is any
element that is less that is coming over here and it is being swapped .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you have seen this swap algorithm earlier .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that is being swapped here and then I update j and I go on doing this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is how I can
apply the sorting algorithm that we had learnt ,COMMA  for sorting student records all right .PERIOD 

Next the other thing that we have to look at is pointers and structures .PERIOD  How they can be
intermingled ?QUESTIONMARK  You may recall that the name of an array stands for the zeroth element of the
array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if this is an array of the name a ,COMMA  then the name a and a 0 are synonymous and so ,COMMA  a can be considered to be a pointer that is pointing to a 0 all right .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  consider the declaration .PERIOD  This is also true for the names of arrays of structures .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I have a declaration like this ,COMMA  you look at the declaration yourself .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you can see student is a structure and I have declared of the type student and array class 100 and star p t r .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  what is star ptr ?QUESTIONMARK  What does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK  You know by now .PERIOD  Just as we had done this (keep it
side by side ) int star p what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK  It means that p is a pointer that points to integer data type .PERIOD  Here it means that ptr is a pointer that points to stud type of structures .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  what do I have ?QUESTIONMARK 

I have got an array called class ,COMMA  each element of which is of type student structure and I have got a pointer ptr ,COMMA  which can point to such structures .PERIOD  It can point to such structures -any of these I have not yet initialised this .PERIOD 

The name class therefore ,COMMA  represents the address of the zeroth element of the structure array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I have this then this class means it is a pointer that is pointing to this element plus 0 .PERIOD  Just like an array and ptr is a pointer to the data objects of type struct ,COMMA  that we have seen .PERIOD 

The assignment - class assigned to ptr what will it make ?QUESTIONMARK  It will make ptr to point to the first
element of the array .PERIOD  Here is class and ptr is now pointing ,COMMA  (when I do this assignment note that
they are of the same type) to this element .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it will assign ptr to class 0 ,COMMA  understood ?QUESTIONMARK  When the pointer ptr is incremented by 1 ,COMMA  that is ptr
plus plus you should be able to tell me what will happen .PERIOD  The ptr will be incremented to the next
element of the array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the actual increment will be by a scale factor and what is that scale
factor ?QUESTIONMARK  That scale factor is size of stud ,COMMA  size of the structure stud and you know that it has got a
roll number ,COMMA  it has got c g p a .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  depending on the different data types that are housed is inside that structure it will vary .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
the value of ptr will point to the next element which will be incremented by size of stud .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  its permit to point to the next record .PERIOD  Once ptr points to a structure variable ,COMMA  now this is
something new ,COMMA  the pointers can be accessed as ptr role ,COMMA  that is possible .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us see what is
happening you are being introduced to this operator ,COMMA  the arrow operator .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here or this only comes if the left side of this operator is a pointer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if suppose I have got
some structure and pointer p or ptr is pointing to this structure and it has got different fields say
cgpa is a field .PERIOD  If I write ptr arrow c g p a ;SEMICOLON  that means that I am now pointing to this ,COMMA  I am
actually accessing this element of the structure .PERIOD 

Just as suppose this structure is class and this element is class 1 say .PERIOD  I could have written class 1 dot cgpa and here I have already done this  ,COMMA  the pointer ptr was assigned to class 0 and then I did ptr plus plus ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  now where is ptr pointing to ?QUESTIONMARK  ptr is pointing to class 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can now also do ptr arrow cgpa .PERIOD  These two are equivalent ,COMMA  this and this are equivalent .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here also you can understand this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us move ahead .PERIOD 

Similarly ,COMMA  I can go to another field by ptr slash department code ,COMMA  I can go ptr cgpa ,COMMA  ptr roll  ,COMMA this
symbol is naturally called the arrow operator .PERIOD 

You can read this type def ,COMMA  now here I am defining a type ,COMMA  the name of the type is complex and
what is this type complex .PERIOD  It is a structure with a real and imaginary part ,COMMA  this is what we saw
earlier .PERIOD 

Next I have got a function - print complex star  ,COMMA  what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK  A is a pointer to type
complex .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  print f ,COMMA  whatever there are two placeholders - a real ,COMMA  a imaginary .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  why is it
possible ?QUESTIONMARK  ‘a’ is a pointer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is pointing to some complex number ,COMMA  whatever that is .PERIOD  ‘a’ is a
pointer pointing to that and I am going to the real part ,COMMA  I am printing a real and this part is a
imaginary .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is what is being done by this piece of function code .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now swap reference ,COMMA  I have got complex a and complex b .PERIOD  I am sorry it is not visible here .PERIOD  a
and b there are two pointers in complex .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  there is t m p .PERIOD  I take another structure named t m p
of type complex ,COMMA  and I swap the pointers here .PERIOD 

That is why you can you can work it out that ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  that ‘a’ was pointing to some structure
and that ‘a’ is pointing to this structure and this particular structure is copied to another structure
temp ,COMMA  then ‘b’ was pointing to another structure b and a are swapped .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  ‘b’ is pointing to
this and ‘a’ is pointing this next I am making b point to this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is how a swap operation can
be done and how we passed on the parameter to this .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the main program can be can define complex x ,COMMA  10 and 3 ,COMMA  y is minus 20 minus 10 because of
the resolution it is not visible .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  print x and y then swap reference print x and y .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  can you
guess and tell me whether the swapping will work in this case or not  ?QUESTIONMARK  The answer is yes it will
work because it is a call by reference .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  whatever I am swapping here ,COMMA  that will be reflected in
the main program also .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here is an example .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us move ahead .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  one warning is there that ,COMMA  when using a structure pointers ,COMMA  we should take care of the
operator precedence .PERIOD  Because here we have seen the star symbol as well as dot symbol ,COMMA  now this dot has a higher precedence than star ,COMMA  what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK 

It means that if I have got something like ptr roll and star ptr dot roll the dot will have a higher
precedence .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these two are the same thing - ptr roll (ptr is a pointer and the roll is that
particular field) and star ptr is what ?QUESTIONMARK  Star ptr is the particular structure ,COMMA  and I am going to the roll
field of that structure .PERIOD 

But if I had done this that would be an error why ?QUESTIONMARK  That would be an error because this dot
operator has got higher precedence than this star operator .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  basically I will try to get the role
filled from the pointer p t r ,COMMA  but that is not the case ,COMMA  there is no roll field inside the pointer p t r .PERIOD 
The roll field is there in the content of the pointer ptr that is star p t r .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I must make first star ptr within bracket then dot roll .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is correct ,COMMA  but this is wrong the
and the operator arrow enjoys the highest priority among operators among all these operators it
has got the highest priority .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here in this case what will happen ?QUESTIONMARK  plus plus ptr arrow roll - as we have said that this has got the highest priority ,COMMA  we will go to where the ptr is and go to the roll field of that and after that we will increment this plus plus ,COMMA  although it is shown as a pre increment .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that will not have
higher precedence than the arrow operator .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if I want to first increment the ptr and then get the roll ,COMMA  then I should do plus plus ptr arrow
roll which will do the intended thing ,COMMA  I hope this is clear this part .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  structures and functions .PERIOD  Structures can be passed as argument to a function and a function that we have already seen .PERIOD  A function can also return a structure .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we have seen that using two complex numbers how we can do that .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here again we look at that example that we have got a complex structure with two fields .PERIOD  I
have now changed the names - float r e and float i m ,COMMA  and in the main function I am scanning

and a dot r e ,COMMA  real part of a ,COMMA  imaginary part of a ,COMMA  then real part of b then imaginary part of b and
then I call the function add a b .PERIOD  What is happening here when I call this add a b ?QUESTIONMARK  What am I
passing ?QUESTIONMARK I am passing a b and here x y .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it is a call by value .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here this is copied ;SEMICOLON  now i have struct complex x y (there is no
problem here it is not like swap I just want to add) .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have got two internal variables x and y
and t ,COMMA  that new structure t is taking x’s real part and y’s real part ,COMMA  then I am getting the real part
of t and in the imaginary part of t there is nothing here .PERIOD  There is an excess space .PERIOD  In the
imaginary part of t ,COMMA  I take the imaginary part of x and the imaginary part of y ,COMMA  then I am returning
this t to c ,COMMA  where c is also of type complex since the types are matching ,COMMA  I can pass it on over
there .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  this is one way of adding the complex numbers .PERIOD  Now if this is clear ,COMMA  now let us look at an
alternative way of using the pointers .PERIOD 

Here I just changed this ,COMMA  other things are the same .PERIOD  What I am doing here is I have called them ,COMMA 
passing the address ,COMMA  now I am passing the pointers .PERIOD  In the earlier case I was passing the value
here and now I am passing the pointers .PERIOD  I am passing address of a ,COMMA  address of b and address of c .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  inside this add function ,COMMA  what am I doing ?QUESTIONMARK  I am taking x and y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these are pointers .PERIOD  I am
taking them and t ,COMMA  t is real .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  t is a pointer that is pointing to another structure of the type complex and t is r e ,COMMA  t arrow r e
means a real field of this t ,COMMA  will be taking the real part of x and real part of y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here x plus y ,COMMA 
the sum will come ,COMMA  this the real part of x and real part of y will come here ,COMMA  and here the
imaginary part of x and y will be added .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  when here I am not returning any t ,COMMA  because this t is nothing ,COMMA  but this c .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this t and c are
mapped ,COMMA  it is a call by reference .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  c is also actually pointing over here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I get the result
here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is another way in which in structures ,COMMA  we can use pointers also .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these are
relatively more advanced aspects and you will gradually practice this and we will get familiar .PERIOD 

Thank you .PERIOD 

We have looked at pointers and structures in detail and we have also seen how structures can
also utilise pointers or in other words how pointers can be used in conjunction with structures .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  we look at another very interesting use of pointers ,COMMA  but in general let me say that it is a very fundamental concept ,COMMA  from the memory allocation point of view .PERIOD 

Dynamic memory allocation is what we will be discussing now .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  what if there is a dynamic
memory allocation then ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA  there must be something called the static memory allocation
now what is static memory allocation ?QUESTIONMARK 

When we declare an array say int A 20 ,COMMA  you know that the compiler will allocate 20 locations ,COMMA  20
locations to house 20 integers to you and that will be named as A or you can also consider that
there is a pointer A ,COMMA  which is pointing to the first element of the array .PERIOD  But you have got space for
20 locations ,COMMA  20 integers allocated to you .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  you know size of .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  how many bytes will be required ?QUESTIONMARK  You can say 20 times size of
int .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  size of int will return you how many bytes your particular system allocates for an integer
and 20 such allocation .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  so many bytes will be allocated to you .PERIOD  Now when that is statically
allocated that is allocated at compile time ;SEMICOLON  so ,COMMA  when we say static allocation that means ,COMMA 
allocation at compile time right .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  if for some reason you need more than 20 integers to be stored in this array A  ,COMMA  you will
need to redefine this whole thing or in some cases we do not know ,COMMA  we do not have an idea of
how many date data items will come for example ,COMMA  you was you are actually storing student
records in an array class ,COMMA  and you do not know how many students will join that class
beforehand .PERIOD 

If you know that beforehand its fine or if you have an idea that what is the maximum number of
students that can come ,COMMA  then its fine you can allocate it in the form of static allocation as we do in an array .PERIOD 

However ,COMMA  when we do not know and the information comes at a runtime ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  when is
being executed ,COMMA  that will lead to what we call dynamic allocation of memory .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us look at
how we can handle it .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the basic idea is I have already explained that we have an amount of data we cannot predict
beforehand .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we will use effectively whose dynamic memory allocation technique to do that .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  C language requires a number of elements to be specified in compiled time ,COMMA  when we
define in an array we need to specify that in compile time .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  often that leads to wastage of
memory or program failure .PERIOD  Why a program failure ?QUESTIONMARK  Program failure will occur because if we
exceed the amount of space that has been allocated ,COMMA  there will be a failure the program will give
an error or it will exit abnormally .PERIOD  However ,COMMA  if we take recourse to dynamic memory allocation ,COMMA 
we can solve this problem how ?QUESTIONMARK  Memory space required can be specified at the time of execution
how can we do that ,COMMA  how can I specify the amount of memory required at the time of execution ?QUESTIONMARK 

If while running the program ,COMMA  just like the instructions and operators ,COMMA  if we had some special
means ,COMMA  some special command ,COMMA  some special operator by which we can grab memory then it’s
possible .PERIOD  Now here you should understand that who allocates memory to us ?QUESTIONMARK  It is the operating
system which allocates the memory to us .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this like the print f ,COMMA  scan f all those things are system calls .PERIOD  We are making calls to the
operating system ,COMMA  which is doing the required thing for us .PERIOD  Similarly there is a function called
Malloc - Memory Allocated ,COMMA  malloc using which we can grab memory from the operating system
how let us look at this .PERIOD 

In memory in C ,COMMA  I have got different types of variables that is not so ,COMMA  much relevant right now .PERIOD 
What is needed is this part .PERIOD  These global variables and instructions are there always specified .PERIOD 

The local variables are there and there is some free memory .PERIOD  We can take from this free memory and use them as our local variables .PERIOD  The free region is has got a name heap .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  the most important thing is that we need some functions ,COMMA  which will give my program
some memory addresses or memory blocks from the operating system storage of memory ,COMMA  which is known as heap from there it will be allocated to my program all right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  for that we have got four different functions - one is malloc ,COMMA  what does malloc do ?QUESTIONMARK  Malloc
allocates the requested number of bytes and returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated
space .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what it does is something like this ,COMMA  what is happening ?QUESTIONMARK  (Refer Time: 08:31) .PERIOD  Malloc
allocates a requested number of bytes and returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated space .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  let us try to explain this .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  when I do malloc ,COMMA  it is just like a function and it will return some memory bytes  ,COMMA  some
memory bytes .PERIOD  How many memory bytes ?QUESTIONMARK  It will depend on ,COMMA  what I am requesting for .PERIOD  It is a
requested number of bytes .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  malloc will have some parameters which will show later .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it will give some give me some amount of memory .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  the operating system has got some
free memory spread here and there .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  from there it is giving me some piece of memory ,COMMA  but

how do I know where is that piece of memory ?QUESTIONMARK  For that ,COMMA  it is returning me a pointer say pointer p
which is telling me that if you follow this pointer ,COMMA  you will get this piece of memory location .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  let us proceed a little bit .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  similarly when this memory block is given in response to malloc request ,COMMA  the actual
memory is not initialised to some value .PERIOD  It can have any garbage value .PERIOD  But if I apply calloc ;SEMICOLON 
then it allocates space for the array of elements and initialises them to zero and returns a pointer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in this case if I want to have a chunk of memory where everything has been initialised to zero then I should use calloc .PERIOD  On the other hand the free function call will return this amount of
memory ,COMMA  that was given to me in request to malloc ,COMMA  will be returned back to the heap ,COMMA  returned
back to the operating system so ,COMMA  that it can be utilised by somebody else in future all right .PERIOD 

So realloc modifies the size of the previously allocated space .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have got some allocation and then I think that allocation is not enough .PERIOD  I want to change it .PERIOD  I can use realloc .PERIOD  However ,COMMA  we will be mostly concerned with malloc and free in our discussion .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  a block of memory can be allocated using the function malloc and it reserves a block of
memory and returns a pointer of type void .PERIOD  You know every pointer has got some type ,COMMA  but in
this case with malloc returns some memory block ,COMMA  the pointer that it has returned is of type void ,COMMA 
but then we have to do something .PERIOD  What we need to do ?QUESTIONMARK  I know why I needed this memory .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
accordingly I will have to do that typecasting .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  once it returns me of type void ,COMMA  but that return
pointer can be assigned to any pointer type .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here you see .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here please note ,COMMA  malloc has got a parameter of byte size - how much memory I want ,COMMA  the
amount of bytes which is required .PERIOD  Now this malloc has returned me up to this ,COMMA  it has returned
me a pointer and pointer is of type void ,COMMA  but suppose if this amount of memory I want for the
purpose of storing integer array then this type will be int star ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I am casting this .PERIOD  What is malloc returning ?QUESTIONMARK  Malloc is returning a pointer ,COMMA  some pointer ,COMMA  but that pointer was of type void .PERIOD  Now when I am typecasting it to int star ,COMMA  then this void is no longer it’s type ,COMMA  it is becoming of type int and then I am assigning it to another variable p t r .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  think of two things ,COMMA  first of all you have to decide on how many bytes you want .PERIOD  Accordingly
you do malloc and then what type of data you want to store there ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  accordingly you do this
typecasting like int star ,COMMA  float star ,COMMA  char star whatever you do and then you assign it to a particular
pointer .PERIOD  Let us see how it will work .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us look an example .PERIOD   .PERIOD 

Here ,COMMA  how do I know how many bytes I need ?QUESTIONMARK  Suppose I need to store an element an array of 100 integers .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what I do here is I ask for malloc 100 times size of int ,COMMA  size of int if it is 4 ,COMMA  if int is 4 then I am getting 400 bytes .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  these 400 bytes that have been given to me is being pointed by some pointer of type void .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  next I make it int star and put it to p .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  p is now an integer pointer that is pointing to this
entire block of 400 integers .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  a memory space equivalent to 100 times the size ,COMMA  we have got .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here 400 bytes of space
and p is a pointer pointing to the beginning of this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have got this just using malloc ,COMMA  it was
not declared beforehand .PERIOD 

Now so ,COMMA  this 100 can also be a variable n ,COMMA  if I read a particular variable n now how many students
are there ?QUESTIONMARK  scan f m and n .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I read the number of students ,COMMA  then I can multiply that with n as
well .PERIOD 

Next ,COMMA  you see here I am seeking memory for 20 characters ,COMMA  I do malloc 20 because I know a
character takes one byte and then the pointer is of type void I am typecasting it to type character char star and assigning it to c p t r .PERIOD  Now it is actually wrong ,COMMA  it is allocating 20 bytes of space for the pointer .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  integer character was simple ,COMMA  now I want to have for space for the entire structure students ,COMMA 
now that size is larger .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I do not know .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I just have employ this function size of struct stud .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I gets how many bytes ?QUESTIONMARK  Say it requires say 40 bytes and say 10 such for 10 such students or n such students .PERIOD  I multiply with that I get so ,COMMA  much memory ,COMMA  now I have to typecast that to struct stud star and that goes as a structure pointer .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  malloc always allocates a block of contiguous bytes .PERIOD  Now suppose you are asking for 100
bytes and 100 bytes are not available then malloc will not be able to allocate you the space ,COMMA  in
that case malloc will return in null .PERIOD  That is a null pointer ,COMMA  that is a special character special value
it will return ,COMMA  that shows that I could not allocate a space .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I could not allocate it to you a valid pointer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is a null pointer meaning thereby I failed
in allocating your memory .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is an example .PERIOD  Here let us look at it from one side - I n  ,COMMA  float is a pointer ,COMMA  height is a
pointer of type float ,COMMA  sum is 0 and average .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what am I trying to do ?QUESTIONMARK  Probably I am trying to
find the average height of the class .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  input the number of students and I am reading
ampersand .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this one is ampersand n .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is n number of students .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  see I did not know how many students are there .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am getting this number of students
here ,COMMA  I am getting n number of students here .PERIOD  Now I want to have an amount of spaces for the
height .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what I am doing ?QUESTIONMARK  I am allocating n number of spaces ,COMMA  n is a variable here and size of float ,COMMA  whatever size of float is 4 bytes .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  n times 4 bytes ,COMMA  so much space is being allocated ,COMMA  and the pointer is height is a pointer of type float .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this pointer is being type casted to float .PERIOD  Then I get the input scan f in a loop ,COMMA  I am getting the heights one after another in an array and I am finding the sum of the heights ,COMMA  finding the average of the heights ,COMMA  where I am dividing sum which is a floating point number with float n .PERIOD  Here is
another example of typecasting .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you see I am dividing by n ,COMMA  but this is a floating point real
number ,COMMA  n was an integer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I convert it to float and convert it divided .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is how malloc works now .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we have explained that .PERIOD 

Similarly the general format for freeing space is using by using the free function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  general
now suppose I have got a space allocated to me and that space ,COMMA  the only handle to that space is to the pointer p .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I free that pointer ,COMMA  I free p .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the pointer is freed ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  this pointer is freed means
this location ,COMMA  this amount of memory goes back to the storage of the operating system and that is the heap .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  whatever we got in malloc that gives us some idea about how we can get space and reallocate
space .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  briefly we I will be talking for the next 5 or 10 minutes on file handling ;SEMICOLON  there is not much
to understand about file handling thus you will learn as you do .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  what is a file  ?QUESTIONMARK  That is

something you have to understand .PERIOD  File is something where I want to write something write or
read from .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I want to store something .PERIOD  I will take a particular file all right ;SEMICOLON  and I will open that file and
then I will write in the into that file then close that file and then in that way I may have 10 files .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  at a particular point of time I want to read a particular thing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I choose the particular file
what do I do next ?QUESTIONMARK  Open the file and read the file .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  some files may be allowed to be read by
others ,COMMA  some files can only be written in to and not read from ,COMMA  some files can have the option of
read or write both .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  file is some space where I will be writing or reading from some storage .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is there in the secondary memory and till now whatever variables we are talking about ,COMMA 
those who are all in the primary memory .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I store it in a file it goes into the secondary
memory .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us have a little idea of how files are handled .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now again now we have learnt pointers .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  any file can be accessed using a pointer .PERIOD  Just as if I have the file of income tax .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will have a pointer that there is the file of income tax ,COMMA  here there is some file of road tax it will be here some file of your salary ,COMMA  it will be somewhere here ,COMMA  some file of your expenses it will be somewhere else .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  there will be pointers .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we use in c ,COMMA  the file star .PERIOD  We use file star to represent pointed to a
file and if open is the command for opening a file .PERIOD  If a file cannot be opened then it will return a
null just as in the case of malloc ,COMMA  we saw if nothing could be returned it was returning a null .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here for example ,COMMA  you see f p t r is a pointer of type file .PERIOD  That means ,COMMA  f p t r will be pointing
to file .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  I have got a character file name whic is an array ,COMMA  file 2 dot dat it is a data file .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
fptr is f open file name and here when I do f open ,COMMA  I give the file name as well as the mode in
which it can be opened and this w means it is in the right mode .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what have I done here ,COMMA  I
have called f open .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I am trying to open the file .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this f open will return up file pointer .PERIOD  Now if this file pointer
is null ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  there was some error in file creation otherwise it will go on doing something .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  quickly let us look at this ,COMMA  when I do f open it will open a file and will open it in a particular
mode ,COMMA  read or write whatever I specify and it will return me a pointer .PERIOD  If a file is created
successfully ,COMMA  it will return me a non null pointer .PERIOD 

The second argument of f open is the mode and there are three modes .PERIOD  R means the file is opened for reading ,COMMA  w means it creates a file for writing and writes over all the previous contents .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I open it in the write mode ,COMMA  whatever content was in that file is erased .PERIOD  And a opens a file for appending ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  whatever is there after that it will be added .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if you have got something already stored and you do not want to destroy that and you want to add something more to that you will open it in mode a and rb reads a binary file ,COMMA  raw bytes we
need not bother about that .PERIOD 

There is a function called exit which you have seen ,COMMA  sometimes in the emergency we can put exit minus one ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  it tells that I have exited the function without success .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  here you see use of exit .PERIOD  file f pointer ,COMMA  character file name is an array ,COMMA  file 2 dot dat .PERIOD  I tried
to do something .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the file pointer was null .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if it is null then what can I do ?QUESTIONMARK  I will have to exit because of some reason the file could not
be created .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  f open we have seen ,COMMA  f print is a very important command .PERIOD  f print works just like print f and s
print f ,COMMA  except that the first argument is a file pointer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we will see how it works .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  fptr is
again the file pointer and I have opened the file dot dat in the right mode .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  print f means
now I am printing .PERIOD  Where am I printing ?QUESTIONMARK  A file called file dot dat has been opened .PERIOD 

The name of the file is file dot dat and how do I identify it ?QUESTIONMARK  I identify it with the fptr ,COMMA  the file
pointer ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it opened in the write mode .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  everything ,COMMA  whatever was there has been erased .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I am writing ,COMMA  just as you have done print f then automatically by default it goes to the screen ,COMMA 
here it is not default here I have said fptr .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  whatever I write hello world ,COMMA  it will be written in this file not in the screen .PERIOD 

Screen is another file ,COMMA  but that is a default file .PERIOD  Reading a data similarly ,COMMA  we printed using f print
f ,COMMA  reading we can do using f scan f ,COMMA  forget about that part look at this .PERIOD  fptr - I am reading from not
from the keyboard now .PERIOD  I am reading x and y two integers from a file which is pointed out by f p
t r and what is that file f p t r ?QUESTIONMARK  I have opened the file input dot dat .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you see in that file input dot dat 20 and 30 was written and so ,COMMA  f scan f I have read that ,COMMA  that
was input dot dat ,COMMA  I have opened that in the read mode and I am reading from there .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am
getting x to be 20 and y to be 30 ,COMMA  not from the keyboard ,COMMA  but from the file .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA now here are some powerful commands .PERIOD  We can read a string using fgets ,COMMA  from a file I can
read a string .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here you see a file is f p t r and a line is of size 1000 ,COMMA  while f gets line is not
null ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I am getting from f p t r ,COMMA  a value and if it is not null ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  it is not the end
of the line ,COMMA  the file is open ,COMMA  I am reading the line using f gets .PERIOD  I am getting the line .PERIOD  f gets takes
three arguments ,COMMA  what are the three arguments its taking ?QUESTIONMARK  A string ,COMMA  a maximum number of
characters ,COMMA  1000 and a pointer from it returns .PERIOD  If there is an error at the end of file it shows EOF
which is the end of file .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  this I think you can understand much better when you use yourself ,COMMA  now when we open a
file after that we must close that file we can simply use a command f close and the file pointer .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  here you see f p t r ,COMMA  I opened the file in the right mode ,COMMA  I have written hello world over here ,COMMA  f
print f means saying I am printing in the file ,COMMA  and then f close ,COMMA  I am closing the file by f close f p t
r all right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here it is opening and here is access and here it’s closing .PERIOD 

You have seen that s t d in ,COMMA  s t d out ,COMMA  were two special cases of files ,COMMA  which are default files and s t d error which was the printing of the error .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is an example program you can see that .PERIOD  Main ,COMMA  f print f s t d out give value of i ;SEMICOLON  that
means ,COMMA  where am I printing this ?QUESTIONMARK  Here I am printing it to the standard output .PERIOD  I am reading I from
the standard input .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  f print f I am writing that the value of i is whatever value of i read .PERIOD  So
there is no error  .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  give value of i ,COMMA  it will first give value of i ,COMMA  you give 15 ,COMMA  then f print f that i ,COMMA 
then it will say value of i is equal to 15 and there are no error ,COMMA  but an example to show error
message .PERIOD 

If there is an error for example I am being returned a null pointer in that case I can use output s t
d error and say the file failed to open the file that sort of message .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now another thing I will just talk about here ,COMMA  that will come in very handy to you that is say
for example ,COMMA  you must be running the programs and you after you compile the program and link
them you are creating an executable file ,COMMA  which is a dot out ( dot slash a dot out) .PERIOD  Now usually
what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK  You have got the dollar ,COMMA  those of you using Linux shell ,COMMA  a dot out right and
return .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  this dot slash a dot out what is it expecting ?QUESTIONMARK  The input from the keyboard s t d in and the
output is going to std out ,COMMA  but I do not want that .PERIOD  I want that I have got a file where my input data
is there .PERIOD 

I call that in dot dat and I have got another file which is known as out dot dat .PERIOD  I want that the
input to be taken from this .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I want a dot out to read the data from here and the result should be written here .PERIOD  I can do that in the unix environment very simply by this redirection operation .PERIOD  You see ,COMMA  a dot out will run
taking data from in dot dat and sending the output data to out dot dat .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  say for example ,COMMA  in dot dat has got 15 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I do that and the program runs and says give the
value of i (think of the earlier example ,COMMA  earlier program) and it reads from here and it prints the
value of i to be15 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this whole thing is coming in out dot i .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  let us once again look at this thing .PERIOD  Here I am asking ,COMMA  them to give the value of i which is
being given and that is being scanned from the input file and this is being written on the output
file .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in the output file both these things are being written ;SEMICOLON  consequently ,COMMA  you see ,COMMA  what I am
getting is this output - out dot dat and in dot dat ,COMMA  there are two files .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this in this way you can use files for storing data you have to open the file ,COMMA  let me summarise a little bit ,COMMA  you will have to open the file ,COMMA  in the read mode ,COMMA  read the data from that file ,COMMA  do the operation ,COMMA  open another file in the write mode and write the data into that file .PERIOD  Thereby ,COMMA  whenever you require some file operations ,COMMA  you can easily do that and this is one example that we have shown which is very common during running your programs .PERIOD  If you store some data in a particular file and read from there and write into another file you can utilise this sort of structures
this sort of commands .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  thank you very much ;SEMICOLON  I think you have got an overall idea of how to write c programs and
solve problems using programs because our the essence of our course was to solve problems
through c programming .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you should choose different problems and you should try to write programs for solving those
problems .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first you have to find out the proper algorithm ,COMMA  and then write the C code for that ,COMMA 
you have learnt everything about basic things about the C programming ,COMMA  I have not touched upon some special features ,COMMA  which you can also learn from the book like static variables and all those I have left out intentionally .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that you are not overloaded ,COMMA  you can solve it ,COMMA  the more you run the programs using the basic concepts that has been taught ,COMMA  you will be a good programmer and most importantly you will be able to think logically like a programmer ,COMMA  you will be able to think of an algorithm ,COMMA  and you will
be able to translate that into a program .PERIOD 

Thank you very much .PERIOD
