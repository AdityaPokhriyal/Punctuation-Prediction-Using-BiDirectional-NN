we will have my blank job
backslash n will come here sorry backslash 0 will come here ,COMMA  but s t r l e n means string
length I will count how many elements are there in the string ;SEMICOLON  can you tell me how many
elements are there in the string ?QUESTIONMARK  1 2 3 blank is a valid character 1 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3 4 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  6 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the
string length will be returned that will returned is 6 ,COMMA  similarly we have another function
very popular function string comparison s t r c m p ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I have got two strings
my job and here my job ,COMMA  and I compared them if sorry if they are the same then I will
have a one ok .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that is another function the fourth function is s t r c a t what is meant by
concatenation ?QUESTIONMARK  Concatenation s t r c a t is actually s t r c a t means string concatenation .PERIOD 

That means ,COMMA  if I have a string here say a b c ended with this ,COMMA  and there is another string
say p q r ended with this ,COMMA  when I concatenate it that these two strings what I get is a
joining of these two strings one after another .PERIOD  When I say that string b is concatenated
with a then my pattern will be a b c note that this backslash 0 will not come p q r and
backslash 0 .PERIOD  This is known as concatenation all right of two strings .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is being
given by a function s t r c a t .PERIOD 
Now .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these are the very common functions for string operations .PERIOD  For our job if we
need some other functions we can always write functions which will learn in a couple of
lectures from now ,COMMA  but these are already available in the c library all right s t d i o dot h
and also when we use that square root function  .PERIOD 

And therefore ,COMMA  in order to do that we have to include st string dot h ,COMMA  if you recall we had
said that if you recall we can include always you do that hash include .PERIOD 

Earlier we had included math dot h ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  all the mathematic library of all the
mathematical functions math dot h when we use for example ,COMMA  s q r square root .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this is this is a function that is already inbuilt ,COMMA  inbuilt in this math library similarly for
strings if I use this s t r c p y ,COMMA  s t r c a t ,COMMA  s t r c m ,COMMA  c m p compare ,COMMA  then I have to include
strings dot h in my function alright .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here are some examples .PERIOD 

Very much like a string assignment operator string copy just like an assignment ,COMMA  for
example ,COMMA  we have we are saying string copy string 1 string 2 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  both string 2 will be copied in string 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  assigns the content of string 2 to string 1
assigns the .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is the source this is the destination .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is copied from here to here
say string copy city Calcutta what will happen here ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I am trying to copy city
is a string that is already defined alright I have defined city and I am copying this string
now this is a string constant ,COMMA  this part is a string constant this is a string constant .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  what I am doing is I am I have got a variable city ,COMMA  variable of type string .PERIOD 

Now this how did you define it to be a type of type string it was char city say something
like this char city 20 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  20 characters can come there .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  when I write city s t r c copy city to Calcutta or right now we say Kolkata say we
do Kolkata .PERIOD  Then in this variable Kolkata will be loaded all right a followed by a
backslash 0 right .PERIOD  On the other hand suppose city is here and suppose another city
another string variable is there ,COMMA  which is maybe Mumbai and I copy string copy city my
city ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  what will happen this string ,COMMA  this string my city will come into this
variable city .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this Kolkata will be overwritten and will be replaced by Mumbai .PERIOD  Now Kolkata is of
length 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and Mumbai is 1 2 3 4 5 6 in that case what will happen ?QUESTIONMARK  As I copy
this whole string over here then here Mumbai m will come u will come m b a i and this
backslash 0 will come here and so ,COMMA  the entire string will be kept here the last sorry up to
this and with a backslash 0 here ,COMMA  and the remaining part of unused part of Kolkata will be
lost .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  warning there is an warning here that is assignment operator does not work for
string .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I could not have done string 1 assign string 2 or as we are doing here city
assigned ,COMMA  my city that would not do that assignment operator will not work in the case of
strings .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  city assigned Calcutta is invalid .PERIOD 

String length s t r l e n this is you I will ask you when we teach you function ,COMMA  to write a
function for finding the string length although it is available in the standard c library .PERIOD 
Counts and returns the number of characters in a string .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  len suppose len is a variable
of type integer ,COMMA  len is of type integer len is of type integer and we say s t r l e n string .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  string is some string all right some variable name s t r1e n city .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  city is a variable
and whatever is the n suppose city is Mumbai ,COMMA  it will find out the length of the characters
in this string and that will come in to len .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  len here we will get the value 6 when I do
this function on this on the string .PERIOD 

The null character at the end as I said is not counted because that tells you that you need
not count any further ;SEMICOLON  counting ends with the first null character .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if I do Calcutta if I copy Calcutta the string ,COMMA  constant calculative city and I find out
the length of city it will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and backslash 0 will be left out .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  n is
assigned 8 writing the string length .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  one problem that can be given to you that I am not talking about this function part
right now .PERIOD 
Suppose I am trying to find out the string length of a character string I am trying to find
how do you find out string length I mean its writing a program that is finding the string
length you need not bother about the structure of this as yet ,COMMA  but let us look at the
algorithm purely what is being done ?QUESTIONMARK  Len some variable has been put to 0 and then while
I am not encountering now s t r is an array of course ,COMMA  array of characters .PERIOD  As you can see
its an idea characters as long as that is not equal to backslash 0 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  not the end
of the string I am going to going in going on incrementing this len ,COMMA  len was 0 len
becomes one like that and then we return len after I completed then I return len  .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  this is provided in the of course ,COMMA  I have to include the string dot h ,COMMA  but this thing
this is what I am writing if ,COMMA  but actually this is a already available .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I need not write it ,COMMA 
I need to simply include hash include I call it hash include strings dot h that library .PERIOD 
There similar program is already written and when I write strlen that is the program that
is activated .PERIOD 
String compare is comparing two strings .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we are comparing two strings and returns 0 if they are identical what I just now said
was just the opposite .PERIOD  If they are matching then it returns 0 and if they do not match a
little non intuitive .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  keep it in mind that if the two strings match ,COMMA  then we will return a
0 otherwise will return a non-zero .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  example is here if I compare city with the string Delhi is 0 then I do something .PERIOD  What
does it mean city is a string already ,COMMA  suppose that is again Chennai suppose that is
Chennai and I am comparing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  city is a variable which has got this value ,COMMA  and I am
comparing with Delhi of course ,COMMA  now they are not matching .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will not it will return
non zero .PERIOD  But if the city was Delhi then these two have matched and I would have got a
one here right .PERIOD 
Now ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA  you can also just think and decide how this algorithm can be written
that is 0073o ,COMMA  simple now you have learnt all the tidbits of writing such a program .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if this is not equal to 0 then then we do this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  similarly I can do city 1 city 2 now .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  before that you can simply think of how the algorithm will look like in case of this
suppose I have got two strings .PERIOD 

One is say Chennai and the other string is of course ,COMMA  backslash 0 here instead of n there is
a name here .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  how will you do that ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  you will compare these two character by character .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this
is suppose city 1 and this is city 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you can very easily compare while city 1 i of
course ,COMMA  i has been assigned to 0 here is same as city 2 i what shall we do ?QUESTIONMARK  We will go on
incrementing I plus plus ,COMMA  but and if it is not equal we will come out .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this here I compare here I compare I come here and here I find that city 3 here ,COMMA  city 1
3 and city 2 3 are not the same .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will come out ,COMMA  but what happens if they are same .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I need to put in if they are same I how long shall I go on no mismatch is there
suppose this is also n while city is city 1 is not equal to city 2 ,COMMA  while city 1 is equal to city
2 do I need another condition here yes and city i is not equal to backslash 0 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  are you understanding this ,COMMA  while this condition which I have already written there .PERIOD 
That should be true in order to proceed in order to proceed further for further checking ,COMMA  I
should they are matching .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I should proceed and ,COMMA  but and also the fact should be that
none of these two cities names .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  two strings have reached the end is not equal to this and city 2 i if any one of them has matched has reached the end
then my while condition will be violated .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will not continue any further .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I can keep a flag here that what should I say match is one .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I go on doing this
match will be remaining 1 ,COMMA  whenever I come out of this loop I will make match 0 that
means ,COMMA  it has there has been a match because the convention is that if they are matching
then it should be 0 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you please also try to write this function right this program right
we will ask you to make it a function a couple of lectures later .PERIOD  I hope this is clear this
part please try to understand this condition try to understand this condition all right .PERIOD 
Next we have got the last one that is a s t r c a t .PERIOD  that is rather simple you will also be able
to write the program for that it is two strings are just being kind of concatenated ,COMMA  but one
thing that you must remember appending concatenating means joining ,COMMA  while appending
means at adding one at the end of the other .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  when I write this a b c ,COMMA  p q r then p q r
has been appended to a b c  .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  string 2 is appended to string one ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  it is joined at the end of string 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
the null character at the end of string 1 is removed and string 2 is joined from that point .PERIOD 
(Refer Slide Time: 32:48)

as we said that there can be a b c backslash 0 and then when I append p q r to that ,COMMA  then p
q r will p will replace this and backslash 0 will come here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  ultimately we will have a
b c ,COMMA  p q r backslash 0 all right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  string copy suppose I have name one a string assigned by string copy Amit ;SEMICOLON  A m i t .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  it looks like this a m i t backslash here there is a backslash 0 and there is a blank here
you see the string is not a m i t a m i t blank and another string is name two which is R o
y ,COMMA  then when I append them concatenate them there it will be a m i t blank this blank and
then R o y and this this blank has been replaced by r .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  r has gone here and we will get
this .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this is string concatenation this will often come handy when you type in some
character strings or type and lines or compute using some text strings text English
sentence has been given and you are trying to find out where the verb is and all those
then you need a lot of string operations like this .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is an example here we are reading a line of text and counting the number of
uppercase letters how many uppercase letters are there .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what are the things we are
including here ?QUESTIONMARK  s t d i o dot h and old friend is here ,COMMA  string dot h is also there then look at
this function I have defined a line to be of length 81 big one 81 .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  I have got the variables I and current count is equal to 0 ,COMMA  I am asking the user to
input the line I am reading the line using this format which we just discussed ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA 
anything can come here I mean anything can come here like a b c slash ,COMMA  dash alright
percentage p whatever is coming except backslash n its coming here and then I am
finding the length of the line .PERIOD 
Suppose the line that was actually typed in in this way through this scan f is say apple
blank is red .PERIOD 

All right and then there is backslash here now this string length s t r l e n will find out the
length of the string 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  12 is n is becoming 12 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  for i equal to 1 to n ,COMMA  now here is another new function that we are finding is upper if
the character is upper case letter ,COMMA  is upper if the character that is being red that that is
being passed here I put in some character and if the character is an upper case letter then
I will count that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  suppose here I make a little change I say this is I say that this is
capital and I say that this is capital .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  what is happening is it is reading character by character from here I 0 onwards ,COMMA  and
checking whether this character is an upper character if that is so ,COMMA  count is becoming 1 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  count becomes one as a is upper case letter ,COMMA  then we go on in this loop i is being
incremented until it comes to 12 less than 12 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here is another one .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will get the
count to be 2 ,COMMA  it goes on and here I will get another one .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  its free print f the number of
uppercase letters is percentage d is now look at this .PERIOD  The number of uppercase letters in
string percentages s is percentage d .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  line will be printed as a line apple is red the
number of uppercase letters in apple is red is 3 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  here this program demonstrates a couple of things .PERIOD 

One is first of all this is a new thing that you have learned is upper ,COMMA  I am just writing it
separately .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that it is clear ,COMMA  but in actual c library the function is written in the form
without this gap or without any special character in between ,COMMA  this is the first thing that we
have learned .PERIOD  And how we have already seen it is an application of what we learnt how
we can read a line using this wildcard format .PERIOD  And then we found out what is the length
of the line by our newly learned function s t r l e n ;SEMICOLON  and using that we have this is this
looping we already know we have practiced it so often .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  we now using this value using this for loop for so ,COMMA  many iterations .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  many
repetitions that is determined by the value of n will check the entire string .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is an
example of applying the string function in string operations ,COMMA  will go further with some
more examples later .PERIOD 

We have looked at arrays and their utility ,COMMA  we have in particular looked at one
dimensional array and today we will introduce another variety of array ,COMMA  which is 2-
dimensional array .PERIOD  In fact ,COMMA  we can have multi-dimensional arrays in general arrays can
be ;SEMICOLON  we can have in n dimensional array .PERIOD 

For a particular value of n equal to 1 ,COMMA  we are having this one-dimensional array ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Where ,COMMA  I have got some say 1 dimensional array of integers .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  for n equal to 2 we can
have 2 dimensional arrays ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  where there will length and there will be a
breadth of the array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that array can be considered of consisting of a number of 1
dimensional arrays for example ,COMMA  as I am showing in this diagram I have got 2 dimensions
on this dimension ,COMMA  I have got 4 rows on and on this dimension ,COMMA  I am sorry ,COMMA  this let me
draw it a fresh .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  on this side I have got 4 rows and ,COMMA  on this side ,COMMA  I have got 1 2 3 4 5 6 positions .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
these are called columns and these are called rows ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  here I have got 2
dimensions one is the length ,COMMA  that is 6 or 6 columns and the breadth which is 4 rows
since ,COMMA  these 2 dimensions .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is a 2-dimensional array .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  a 2-dimensional array like this can be considered to be consisting of see in this case 4
1 dimensional arrays arrange one after another .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is one array ,COMMA  which we learnt till
now this is another array this part is another array this part is another array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we have
got 4 different arrays 1 2 3 4 ,COMMA  4 different arrays arranged one after another .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I can have for n equal to 2 ,COMMA  I have got rows and columns .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we get 2 dimensional
arrays .PERIOD  Similarly ,COMMA  for n equal to 3 we can have 3 dimensional arrays ,COMMA  like so I have got
one 2 dimensional arrays like this ,COMMA  and we can think of another 2 dimensional array line
here ,COMMA  another 2 dimensional array line here ,COMMA  in that way I can have an arrangement of say
may be 3 or 4 ,COMMA  2 dimensional arrays one after another ,COMMA  that is also an arrangement each of
these may be 4 rows and 6 columns ,COMMA  sorry may be like this 4 rows and 6 columns .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this row this 3-dimensional array will be 4 rows 6 columns and 4 such ,COMMA  2 dimensional
arrays this is one 2-dimensional array this another 2-dimensional array ,COMMA  I am and this one
2-dimensional array and we have got 4 such 2-dimensional arrays arranged one after
another ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  If I had a one more here ,COMMA  if I had one more here ,COMMA  same array then this
would be changed to 5 ,COMMA  in that way I can extend my concept of arranging data as we had

done for 1 dimensional array ,COMMA  we are extending it to 2 dimensions 3 dimensions in that
way ,COMMA  it be difficult to concept I mean show it on the this screen we can go up to n .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  n dimensional arrays ,COMMA  which will have different dimensions all together ,COMMA  but today we
will be just discussing about 2 dimensional arrays and the thing is quite general and can
be extended to other dimensional arrays also
So ,COMMA  we are now ,COMMA  talking about 2 dimensional arrays you can see the most common
example of 2-dimensional array is a table means an arrangement of data just like this .PERIOD 
This is list arrangement of information is known as a table ,COMMA  often we see table in other
forms also for example ,COMMA  I can have a table of something like this .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the first here I put name of the boy ,COMMA  name of a student then I store age of a student ,COMMA 
school to which the student goes and address of the student may be ,COMMA  and I have got such
scope of keeping it for say 4 students one student number 1 ,COMMA  student number 2 ,COMMA  student
number 3 ,COMMA  student number of 4 and I go on .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is this is known as a table because ,COMMA  I
am organising them in a organised in a tabular form .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this is a table .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what we were looking at now ,COMMA  is another table where here I am
showing that ,COMMA  there are 4 students student 1 ,COMMA  student 2 ,COMMA  student 3 ,COMMA  student 4 for each of the
students I have got some marks in the different subjects ,COMMA  subject 1 ,COMMA  subject 2 ,COMMA  subject 3 ,COMMA 
subject 4 and subject 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can consider that all the marks of student 1 in the different

subjects are stored in a row ,COMMA  this row for the first student similarly ,COMMA  this row for the 2nd
student ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  Similarly ,COMMA  this row for the 3rd student and this row for the 4th student .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  each row wise I get the information of all students and column wise if I look in this
direction ,COMMA  what do I get in subject 1 what are the different marks ?QUESTIONMARK  And who have got
what marks ?QUESTIONMARK  And most interesting part is the intersection say for example ,COMMA  this element
of the array what will this element tell me ,COMMA  this element has is identified by it is row and
column ,COMMA  which row it is in and which column it is in ,COMMA  this element is 75 when what is the
meaning of this 75 is the student 2s sub marks of subject 2 ,COMMA  it is in whatever we tell you
can tell ,COMMA  that is the subject to marks of student 2 ,COMMA  this is the subject 3 marks of student 3 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  in that way ,COMMA  I can represent any of these as identified by some row ,COMMA  name row
number and column number recall that ,COMMA  in the case of 1 dimensional array .PERIOD 

When we are talking of one dimensional array there we had indices index ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  that
index was telling us say for example ,COMMA  there are suppose these are marks again out of 10
alright ,COMMA  and I wanted to know what is the marks in subject 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the i value i equal to 0
was pointing me to this ,COMMA  suppose this is marks i value was showing this ,COMMA  if I take the i
value 1 ,COMMA  then I get the marks of this subject like that now ,COMMA  in that case in the case of 1 if I
wanted to have this element ,COMMA  that was identified by i value equal to 0 1 2 3 4 ,COMMA  but in the
case of a 2 dimensional array just as we are seeing here ,COMMA  we will be getting to a particular

element again in the same way with index ,COMMA  but here say for example ,COMMA  this element this
element here .PERIOD 
How do I identify this element ?QUESTIONMARK  This element will be identified by this row and this
column .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my index while this was for one dimensional array the index was i ,COMMA  in this
case the index will be i and j .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  any pair i j pair will identify which row and which
column .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this particular element is determined by the i value again just because ,COMMA  it is
see I am saying that ,COMMA  it is starting from 0 1 2 and here 0 1 2 3 4 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  say this element can
be identified by i is equal to 1 1 ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  For example ,COMMA  this element this element is
identified by sorry ,COMMA  index value i j I am sorry here ,COMMA  the index is 1 1 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  the i j pair a pair is 1 1 for this i should be 1 and j should be 3 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this pair is
identified by 1 ,COMMA  3 whenever I get .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  suppose here this array was marks ,COMMA  similarly I will
have an a name for this 2-dimensional array and I can access any element by this indices ,COMMA 
but in this case since it is a 2-dimensional array ,COMMA  I have got 2 pointers 2 parts of this row
part and the column part .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here you can see that ,COMMA  the subjects are organised in this way
subject marks are organised in this way and we can access any of this elements using the
proper indexes student number and the subject number .PERIOD 

In the table that was shown here ,COMMA  a showing how many elements 1 2 3 4 5 into 420
elements ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  the table contains 20 values 5 in each line and it can be arranged
organises as a matrix 2-dimensional matrix consisting of 4 rows and 5 columns .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  C allows us to define such tables by using 2-dimensional array what does it mean ,COMMA 
the general form is like this type ,COMMA  array name ,COMMA  row size ,COMMA  column size .PERIOD  Always you
compare with what we learned for 1 dimensional array is just an extension of that ,COMMA  for
example ,COMMA  marks 4 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in this case which we saw just now ,COMMA  it is an array with and let us
call this say ,COMMA  the name of this array is it also marks .PERIOD 

And marks has got .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let me write here ,COMMA  because it is marks and it has got 4 rows and it
has got 5 columns .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is how I can describe this array ,COMMA  and then we can go on filling

up the values of this array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  array name ,COMMA  row size and column size .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  for example ,COMMA 
int marks ,COMMA  similarly I can have cells of 25 items over 12 marks may be say ,COMMA  I can have
something like ,COMMA  so let us try to see what this possibly can mean is that suppose I have got
a table where ,COMMA  there are 12 rows alright ,COMMA  I will have 12 rows here and there will be 25
columns here alright ,COMMA  there will be 300 items so I am not showing that .PERIOD 
But say each of these rows may mean say this is January row ,COMMA  this is a February row ,COMMA  this
is a march row etc ,COMMA  and suppose here there are different items or shop has got different
items and in that way it has got 25 different items and here .PERIOD  We write how many units of
a particular this row is shirts alright ,COMMA  this one says that ,COMMA  in the month of February how
many shirts have been sold and may be this says in the month of say this is pen in the
month of January or in the month of January how many pens have been sold ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA  in that way this entire matrix or this array can be named as the arrays cells ,COMMA  which
will have 12 rows and 25 columns ,COMMA  similarly and another very important thing to note is
this type ,COMMA  this type that we declared also in the case of 1 dimensional array is also
applicable here ,COMMA  because each of these elements in this array will be of the same type .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
here cells I am saying and I have said cells is float .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  the way I wrote it is not correct I should write it as say ,COMMA  how many elements are
there ?QUESTIONMARK  What it can be that in the month of January ?QUESTIONMARK  What is the worth of not how many
shirts were sold ?QUESTIONMARK  But ,COMMA  shirts worth how many rupees were sold .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it can be here 100 .PERIOD 5
say because ,COMMA  each of these elements have floating point numbers ,COMMA  alright ?QUESTIONMARK  Similarly ,COMMA 
matrix can be a 100 by 100 matrix where ,COMMA  each of the elements will there double
precision number .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we have got 2 places ,COMMA  2 dimensions that we are specifying here .PERIOD 

Unlike what we did in the case of a 1-dimensional array where ,COMMA  we did something like int
marks say 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  int marks 5 is a 1-dimensional array with 5 elements ,COMMA  I can say that
these are with 5 columns of this 1-dimensional array ,COMMA  which is 1 row had there been more
rows like this ,COMMA  then immediately I have to identify which row and which column and if
there be 2 such rows ,COMMA  then this array should be described as int marks say here ,COMMA  2 5
because ,COMMA  they are rows .PERIOD 

Similar to that of 1 dimensional array ,COMMA  but we use 2 indices ,COMMA  indices is the plural of index
indices ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  the first one indicates the row and the second one indicates the column
both the indices should be expressions which ,COMMA  evaluate to integer values and that was the
case for 1 dimensional arrays also .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I have something like marks 2 5 these integer ,COMMA 
these values must be integers ,COMMA  I can write expressions we will show there later ,COMMA  but those
expressions must evaluate to integer values ,COMMA  alright ?QUESTIONMARK 

Examples are x m n 0 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  whatever m value is m has to be an integer ,COMMA  suppose m here is
2 and n is 1 ,COMMA  then in this array whose name is x we have got a number of rows and a
number of columns ,COMMA  which element am I referring to here ,COMMA  I am referring to row to 0 1 2
3 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am referring to this row and which column I am referring to 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this was 0 1 2
3 4 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am referring to this column therefore ,COMMA  I am actually pointing at this particular
element ,COMMA  alright ?QUESTIONMARK  This particular element .PERIOD 

Similarly ,COMMA  I can do operations like this what does this mean let us try to understands this
means ,COMMA  I have I am referring to 3 different 2-dimensional arrays one is a ,COMMA  which has got
some rows and columns and these another array this is a this is b and I have got another
array c .PERIOD  .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  I am taking what is being done here ,COMMA  this means c i k .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this c is being designated
by an index i ,COMMA  another index k this one is being done by referred by i and some j this 1 by
j and k what is being done here ,COMMA  that for different values of i j and k ,COMMA  I am selecting this
has got a special application ,COMMA  but I am not going to that I am looking at taking at the
taking a particular value from here ,COMMA  that is c i and c k k is pointing here .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this one I am taking and adding that ,COMMA  with the product of a i and j ,COMMA  j might be pointing
somewhere here ,COMMA  I am taking this element and I am taking may be b j for b array j row I
am sorry ,COMMA  j row j should be here ,COMMA  j row and k column .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am taking another element
from here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am taking this element multiplied by this element here ,COMMA  and adding that
with this element that is taken from c ,COMMA  that is what I am doing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this simple example ,COMMA 
but this has got for mode implication you will realise that soon .PERIOD 

Here you see ,COMMA  what we have done here why is this example shown here ,COMMA  you see we are
specifying the index in the form of an expression ,COMMA  suppose j was 2 and here ,COMMA  which one I
am referring to a j into 2 so ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  a 6 followed by whatever value of k was might
be 6 2 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I am referring to the element of the array a ,COMMA  a is an array whose 7th
row and 3rd column element is being taken .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  if this be like this I am taking this 7th row element and 2nd or 3rd column element ,COMMA  I
am taking that value and finding this square root of that ,COMMA  and that is again being put to the
corresponding value of that ,COMMA  is coming to some other variable name actually this should
be since ,COMMA  this an array this should have been kept as some other variable in b ,COMMA  alright ?QUESTIONMARK 

So ,COMMA  how is 2 dimensional arrays stored in memory we know that ,COMMA  a 1-dimensional array
is stored in a memory row I mean in the contiguous memory locations .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  just for the sake of recalling if we had ,COMMA  if I have a 1 dimensional array say 3 5 4 7 ,COMMA 
they were being mapped to the memory actual memory ,COMMA  here is the memory location the
different memory locations and I am storing them here ,COMMA  3 5 4 7 in contiguous locations ,COMMA 
but what happens to the case of 2 dimensional array for example ,COMMA  if I have the array that I
am drawing here ,COMMA  with 3 rows and 2 columns ,COMMA  alright ?QUESTIONMARK 

So ,COMMA  what is the dimension of this array a ,COMMA  a is 3 2 3 rows and 2 columns now ,COMMA  suppose it
is 1 7 5 3 2 0 say those are the values in that ,COMMA  case if I stored it in the memory I can stored
it now ,COMMA  I am drawing how it can be stored in the memory I need 1 2 3 4 5 6 locations in
the memory .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will have 6 locations .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can store them 1 5 2 7 3 0 or I can store
them as 1 7 5 3 2 0 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  what is a difference between these 2 storages this one is I am
storing them column wise and ,COMMA  in this case ,COMMA  I am storing them row wise row after row ,COMMA 
right ?QUESTIONMARK 
In c the compiler stores the arrays row wise ,COMMA  which is often known as in the row major
form and this is the column major form ,COMMA  but in c we are doing it in row major form there
is a specific significance of this .PERIOD  Because ,COMMA  whenever I want to access an element say a
array ,COMMA  I want to find the particular element say 2 3 ,COMMA  which element shall I find out here
for example ,COMMA  here let us take this case and let me try to find out the element say A this is
A capital A I want to find out the element 2 1 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I am actually trying to find out
the row number 2 and element number 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am trying to find this one out .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA 
where will it be if I do not know .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  say this is accidentally I came coming to the same
let us say ,COMMA  let us make this 1 1 1 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  which one row 1 column 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am
actually trying to find this element 3 .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  what is the address of this element ,COMMA  where is it stored you can see that 3 has been
stored here if I store in the column major form ,COMMA  but if I store in the row major form it is

here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  whenever I am trying to find this element out of this memory representation I
will actually have to fetch it from the memory ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  therefore ,COMMA  I have to find out the
address of this and for that ,COMMA  I need to know where it is stored row wise or column wise
since ,COMMA  I know it is row wise .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  how should I go about it since ,COMMA  there are 2 columns ,COMMA  so for the first row I will say
that ,COMMA  if this been my starting address 1000 in the first row we will take 1000 and 1000
this is starting from 1002 ,COMMA  alright ?QUESTIONMARK  This is the first row ,COMMA  this is the second row ,COMMA  and this
means the second-row part and second rows this is one what is this element 5 ,COMMA  this is
second row and 0th element and this one is second row and then the next element .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  it is 1 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  using knowing that ,COMMA  whether it is stored in the row major form or column
major form is very essential in order that ,COMMA  I can find out the address of the element in a 2-
dimensional array ,COMMA  we will continue this further more explanations are required about
this .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we were discussing that how a 2 dimensional array is stored in the memory .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  we have already said that that is and 2 dimensional array is stored in a row wise
form .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we have to find out the address of a particular element in the memory ,COMMA  right .PERIOD 

If we have a 2 dimensional array and the row and the column is specified all right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
say here there are 1 2 3 4 5 rows and 3 columns say a particular element here has got the
address say the name of this array is A this particular element has got the address A 0 1
2 ,COMMA  A 2 3 ,COMMA  A 2 0 1 2 ,COMMA  A 2 2 right this element .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is stored how it is stored this stored in
this consecutive way first this one is stored then this one is stored ,COMMA  then this one is stored
row wise right .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  if in my each of them have got a memory location ,COMMA  so if the location of this is 1000
and if it be an integer array then this location will be 1002 ,COMMA  this location will be 1004 ,COMMA 
this location will be 1006 ,COMMA  1008 ,COMMA  1010 ,COMMA  right ,COMMA  in that way it will go on .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a little thought
will tell you that if the starting address .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will be the starting address ?QUESTIONMARK  What will
be the address of this ?QUESTIONMARK  It will be 1000 plus how many columns have to come for each
column shift for each column .PERIOD  What will be the address of this ?QUESTIONMARK  1010 ,COMMA  1012 ,COMMA  1014 ,COMMA  1016 ,COMMA 
right ,COMMA  actually this should be in the location 1016 of the memory .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  we start with 1000 and then since each of the elements each of the elements are
taking 2 bytes .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will have to go for each shift 2 bytes and how many such shifts .PERIOD 
What is the distance from here to here element wise ?QUESTIONMARK  We have got 8 such positions right
and so with that I can find out the address of this x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if this was x and this was element
was k then what would be my address ;SEMICOLON  k into the offset is so many columns 2 3 ,COMMA  2
columns sorry 2 means 3 columns per row and 3 such rows .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will be 6 rows .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in

general we can say that if x be the starting address of the array in the memory and c be
the number of columns and k be the number of bytes allocated then the address will be x
plus i into c plus j c is the column number plus j .PERIOD  How many columns are there ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  if I
go back to this if I go back to this I can say the how many columns c is each it has got 3
columns .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  k into 3 plus sorry 3 into k plus j right 3 into k means 2 plus j ,COMMA  j was 2 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that will be my result 1000 plus 6 plus two 8 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that will be the location that I will
be finding out .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here that is the formulation ;SEMICOLON  x plus I into c plus j times k ,COMMA  k is number
of bytes allocated per element plus please look at this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the rows are the matrix is
actually stored as a 0 0 ,COMMA  a 0 1 ,COMMA  a 0 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this entire thing is a 0 3 ,COMMA  so 1 2 3 4 so there 4
columns in one row .PERIOD  Then ,COMMA  the second row a 1 ,COMMA  a 1 column 0 ,COMMA  a 1 column 1 ,COMMA  a 1 column 2 ,COMMA 
a 1 column 3 ,COMMA  then ,COMMA  I proceed in this way .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is the arrangement of 3 rows and each
row having 4 columns and using this formula which is intuitive we can find out the exact
location of a particular element .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this part is row 1 this part is sorry this part is row 0 ,COMMA  this part is row 1 ,COMMA  this part is row
2 ,COMMA  you can see that this is row 1 column 0 ,COMMA  row 1 column 1 ,COMMA  row 1 column 2 so and so
forth .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  given so that is how it is stored and how we can find out what the address is ,COMMA  but
how do we read a particular array elements into a 2 dimensional array .PERIOD  We have seen that
I can read one dimensional array the elements of a 1 dimensional array into the array by

repeatedly getting the character from the user and storing it in the proper indexes and
proper positions by varying the index right .PERIOD  Here also we will be reading one element at
a time and we will store them .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my array is say the array that I am storing is a i j
having some rows and columns and i is the row index and j is the column index .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
initially in this for loop look here ,COMMA  there are there is a nested for loop here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first I am
keeping the i fixed for i equal to 0 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  I come here inside this ,COMMA  inside this there is a
nesting of for loop say I have got 4 columns .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  for j is equal to 0 to j less than 4 ?QUESTIONMARK  What
do I do ?QUESTIONMARK  I scanf and a i j now each element here each element here is identified by the
row number and column number and so this one is and a 11 ,COMMA  this one is and a 13 in that
way we do .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  now for j is equal to 0 I read the particular value and store it here suppose it is 5 next
what is done ,COMMA  I am still inside this loop i increment j .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  j comes here note that i is fixed
still how long will a i remain fixed as long as I am inside this inner loop and how long
shall I be inside this inner loop till j reaches the end of the number of columns .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  next I
read the other value .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is 2 ,COMMA  next I read the other value it is 7 ,COMMA  next I read another
value may be it 0 ,COMMA  then it comes to 4 comes to the end of the row because all the columns
have been filled up then I come out of this loop and again go inside this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  i is now
incremented ,COMMA  i is now incremented to this one and I again do the same thing inside this
loop .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this inside this loop is filling up a row and this one is filling up all the rows .PERIOD 

Please take a little time to understand this .PERIOD  This loop ,COMMA  I am once again explaining this
loop is filling up one row keeping i fixed ,COMMA  i is fixed and in a loop I am filling up the
values here ,COMMA  here ,COMMA  here ,COMMA  here and then I increment this one .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this part for filling up all
the rows one by one ,COMMA  I come here again and again fill this up then I increment i and again
fill this up again I increment this i ,COMMA  come here and fill this up all right that is how we read
the elements of an array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is being what is being shown here .PERIOD 

The ampersand is necessary here just as in the case of an array it was necessary it is
necessary here as well .PERIOD  The elements can be entered all in one line or in different lines it
really does not matter whether you pet type 5 ,COMMA  blank 6 ,COMMA  blank 7 ,COMMA  blank 8 or you type 5
enter 6 enter like that that really does not matter because we already know that every
element will be stored in a row wise fashion .PERIOD 

How to print the elements of an array ?QUESTIONMARK  Again ,COMMA  suppose I have got an array ,COMMA  suppose I
have got an array suppose I have got a 2 dimensional array and I will have to print the
elements I cannot just print the array in one shot I cannot do that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  again here I will be
fixed and then I will print say this is a 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first a 00 will be printed
whatever was the value here I am printing it here ,COMMA  then j will be incremented .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the next
one that will be printed will be a 01 ,COMMA  next j will be incremented .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will be a 02 ,COMMA  a 03
so and so forth and then I will be incremented again in this way .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will be next
printing will be a 1 and j will be reinitialised to 0 1 ,COMMA  a 10 ,COMMA  a 11 and like that it will be
printed .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  the elements are since it is a back slash n you can see the elements have printed
one per line because every time I am printing I am giving a back slash n .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  although
the ;SEMICOLON  my array could be 1 2 3 5 4 6 7 9 ,COMMA  it will be printed as 1 2 3 5 4 6 7 9 because at
every point I have given a back slash n .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  here what are we doing here ?QUESTIONMARK  In this case the elements will all be printed in the
same line because I have not put the back slash n .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will be printed all the elements
say sorry all the elements say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ,COMMA  it will be printed in this way if that was the

matrix then this part will be printed in one line and then I go up there is no back slash n
this one will be followed and the entire thing will be printed in one line ,COMMA  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 .PERIOD 

But if I had done this that first I had this again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and I want it to be printed
in this way because here I have not given any back slash n it will be printed one two 3 4
and as it comes out of this loop it goes here and comes to the next row first thing that it
does is printf back slash n .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the control will come here and then 5 6 7 8 will be printed
therefore ,COMMA  this is a better way of printing a 2 dimensional array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that it looks like a 2
dimensional array .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that this will make the elements now the question is you just think how can we print
two matrices side by side .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  suppose there is one matrix 1 2 3 4 another is character
matrix a b c d how can you print them side by side what should we do ?QUESTIONMARK  Can you think of
that ?QUESTIONMARK  I mean if I say I have got two matrices one is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 .PERIOD  Another matrix is say
a b c d .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I they have different dimensions .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  first of all ,COMMA  first of all how can you represent such a metrics ?QUESTIONMARK  Say this matrix how will
you declare that simple this will be a character matrix character let us call the this matrix
let it be M ,COMMA  M is 2 by 2 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  each elements of this matrix will be a character .PERIOD  And
this is int ,COMMA  let it be N ,COMMA  2 by 4 ,COMMA  right .PERIOD  These are the two matrices now you can think of how
you can print two matrices side by side .PERIOD  If I do look at this by this row by this I will first
print 1 2 3 4 and then what should I do ?QUESTIONMARK  I should go to here I should again for j is equal
to j to M call might be j plus plus ,COMMA  I will be doing I will be printing M i j .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this will
come immediately side by side if necessary I could have given another blank in between
and I could have printed this as a complete row next I go up and print this and this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I
suggest that you try to write this program and run it and see whether you get a nice
output or not .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  we come to a very well known problem that we often encounter matrix addition .PERIOD  I
am going to add two matrices .PERIOD  This is a very simple problem .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  all of you know how
this can be done .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I have got a matrix of the same size two matrices .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is 1 2 3 4 7 6 9 2 and there is
another matrix 10 12 15 13 7 14 3 0 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  I want to add them and have another matrix .PERIOD 
First of all this is a matrix of 2 rows and 4 columns 2 rows and 4 columns .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we can
say that this A is a 2 by 4 matrix and this one B is also a 2 by 4 matrix .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  the sum I

will store in another matrix whose dimension will also be two by 4 has to be .PERIOD  And how is
matrix addition done ?QUESTIONMARK  I will first take this element .PERIOD 
What is this element ?QUESTIONMARK  I am saying this element what is this element .PERIOD  This element means
a particular i j value 0 0 element i 0 j 0 from these array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I take this element 1 and
then take b i j of the same i j value 0 0 1 add them together 1 plus 10 I get 11 ,COMMA  I put that
11 in the i j value remaining same 0 0 of the c matrix .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here it is 11 .PERIOD 
Next ,COMMA  I am increasing the index i here j remains sorry I am incrementing whatever I do I
keep the I fixed and increment the j .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  i is 1 ,COMMA  j is 1 is 0 ,COMMA  j is 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  with that I take this
value 2 and take this value with a same i and j value ,COMMA  i is 0 and j is 1 add them .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is
4teen and I store this value here in that way I go on for this entire matrix that is how I do
the matrix addition .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us see how the code looks like for this and let us try to
understand the code this much is include s t d i o dot h then my main program is
continuing .PERIOD  What is being done ?QUESTIONMARK 
Here I am trying to add 2 ,COMMA  I am writing the program for adding 2 matrices of size 100 by
100 let us look at this 100 by 100 ,COMMA  a matrix of size 100 rows and 100 columns ,COMMA  b of 100
rows and 100 columns and c of 100 rows and 100 columns .PERIOD  And I have got other integer
values p q m n .PERIOD  I am reading the matrices ,COMMA  I am reading sorry I am reading m and n
alright two values .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  what is m and n ?QUESTIONMARK  m and n although I have here recall the
difference between I mention about the size and the dimension is the maximum size the
maximum size that it can have 100 and 100 are the maximum sizes of the a matrix and b
matrix ,COMMA  but actually I can have I may not need so many locations .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what I can do ?QUESTIONMARK 

I have got a has got so much size ,COMMA  but actually I am filling up only these say this much .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this is my m ,COMMA  I am sorry this is my m and this is my n ok .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  my actual matrix is small dimension is a largest size that I can accommodate all
right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I need that actual value m and n and then for p is an index p equals to 0 less
than m p plus plus q .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am reading the matrix a ,COMMA  and here you see I am not using the
conventional i j indices I am saying p is keeping account of my row and q is keeping
account of my column .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  for p 0 to m and q 0 to n I am filling up the a matrix ,COMMA  then I
come here fill up this matrix out of this outer loop .PERIOD 
This inner loop ,COMMA  with this inner loop what am I doing I am filling out particular row and
the outer loop I am going to the next column ,COMMA  repeatedly I am saying that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in this way
I read matrix a here ,COMMA  here I read matrix b then I am doing the addition here .PERIOD  Again my the
dimensions of the two matrices will be the same when I add and the result matrix will
also be the same according to matrix algebra ,COMMA  that is I am adding two matrices they will
result in the same dimension matrix .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  again for p equal to 0 to m and q equal to 0 to m
I take c p q .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have taken two matrices .PERIOD 

And now I am generating c matrix where this value this particular element is being
computed by the corresponding element from a and the corresponding element from b
being added I am filling it up and this is going on in a loop all right and so I fill this
entire thing up .PERIOD  What is a last for loop ?QUESTIONMARK  This last for loop is nothing ,COMMA  but printing the
same array ,COMMA  printing the array in the proper way .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  here you please note that it is back slash n .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will come nicely after one row
there will be a we will go to the new line and we will print it this way .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is a matrix
addition which is a very useful very common and simple application of our knowledge of
two dimensional array to start with .PERIOD 
We will other applications of this to in a future .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  the other thing that will be
discussing in the consequence lectures are next .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we now have got an idea of 1
dimensional array and we have got an idea of 2 dimensional array .PERIOD  We have also seen
strings and character arrays .PERIOD  Next ,COMMA  we will move to functions in the next lecture .PERIOD  We
have already mentioned about the term functions while moving and in the course of other
discussion ,COMMA  and we have already seen one particular function that is main function that is
always there is a main body of any C program and we have also seen some library
functions .PERIOD  But next lecture onwards we will look at user defined functions .PERIOD 
We have seen some stored functions in the earlier lecture like string copy ,COMMA  string length ,COMMA 
finding string length ,COMMA  similarly a user can himself or herself write a particular function of

his or her own need .PERIOD  We will have to see why we need to write functions and how a
function can be written from the next lecture onwards .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 

In the earlier lectures ,COMMA  we had discussed about one dimensional array as well as 2
dimensional array ,COMMA  we have seen how one dimensional array can be stored ,COMMA  read and
printed and as well as we saw how a linear search can be applied over one dimensional
array .PERIOD 
Similarly we have seen for 2 dimensional arrays how it can be read ,COMMA  it can be stored ,COMMA  it is
stored in row major form and how it can be printed .PERIOD  Now today we will start discussing
on a very important and vital component of programming and also (Refer Time: 01:06)
of the C language that is functions .PERIOD  The concept of functions is very general and we will
have to first look at it from the general angle why it is required ,COMMA  what is a function ?QUESTIONMARK 
And then we can look at some of the details of this the implementation of this concept in
the C language .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first let us start with functions .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we will we will start to visualise a task .PERIOD 

Suppose I have got a big task alright which I have to implement by programming .PERIOD  Now
any task this is one task this task may be too complicated .PERIOD  And for any human
programmer or any human being to solve this task from the beginning till end in one shot
may be difficult .PERIOD  Often what we do we break up this task into a set of smaller sub tasks ,COMMA 
different sub tasks ?QUESTIONMARK  And each of this sub tasks are smaller enough ,COMMA  small enough .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that
we can manage it better each of these are possibly better managed ,COMMA  alright .PERIOD 
We can say if you think of a program segment a part of a program .PERIOD  If the task is broken
big task is broken down into a small task a number of small tasks ,COMMA  then it is easier to
write the program for each of these smaller tasks .PERIOD  And each of these tasks can be
independently tested for it is correctness ,COMMA  whether it is working properly or not each of
these can be separately tested .PERIOD 
And then if all these are connected together if all these are connected together one after
another and then I can ultimately get this enter task done .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  instead of addressing the
whole task into execute the whole task ,COMMA  or implement the whole task ,COMMA  as a single task it is
often advisable to break it down into a number of subtasks .PERIOD 
Now let us talk about programming ,COMMA  now if we want to know what is a when we say the
term function ,COMMA  if we take the English meaning of that function is means doing something .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  it is a also a task therefore ,COMMA  this entire function can be broken down into smaller
functions and each of this functions can be implemented independently .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the advantage that we get by this means is that we can divide the problem into
smaller parts and thereby we can conquer the small ,COMMA  we can conquer the smaller sub
segments and in the process ,COMMA  we in the process we achieve the complete task that is the
first thing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  by this it is easier to implement and also easier to test or verify .PERIOD 
We can check whether each of these components are working correctly or not .PERIOD  Now
when we find that all the components are working correctly and if they are connected
together correctly ,COMMA  then we will have the entire problem solved correctly that is the first
advantage of writing a complex program broken down into smaller functions .PERIOD 
Now the other advantage is suppose I had 2 implement one task .PERIOD 

And in order to implement this big task ,COMMA  I had to write a number of functions smaller
functions .PERIOD  Say 3 smaller functions together implement this big function alright .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us
call them f 1 function 1 ,COMMA  f 2 for function 2 and f 3 for function 3 .PERIOD 
Now suppose I have now this problem has been solved by solving each of these 3
functions ,COMMA  each of these 3 functions have been written and tested and consequently they
have been connected together and we have got the complete function .PERIOD  Now suppose
another friend of yours wants to write another task solve another task say this was this
was also a task .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this is also a function I am writing that as capital F 1 and there is another friend of
yours who is trying to complete ,COMMA  another task which we are naming as F 2 .PERIOD  Now in order
to develop F 2 ,COMMA  he finds that I have to solve some problems some sub problems ,COMMA  which
are solved by f 1 and another sub problem which is solved by f 3 ,COMMA  might be that this sub
problem requires f 1 ,COMMA  f 3 and say another function which was not written by anybody till
now f 4 .PERIOD 
Now ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA  since f 1 has been written and tested he the writer of f 2 did not write f 1
again ,COMMA  because that f 1 this f 1 can be used for this purpose similarly this f 3 can be used
for this purpose ,COMMA  and only effort that he has to spend is to write f 4 .PERIOD  Thus the functions
which are written already right can be reused .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this reusability is another very important advantage of writing functions .PERIOD  Now we
have said that in order to solve F 1 or F 2 we have to write we will have to independently
write and test smallest functions and connect them together .PERIOD  What do I mean by
connecting them together let us try to understand that .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  say we have a function that is to be done developed and we find that this part has to
be this part ;SEMICOLON  this task has to be solved by some function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I write a function here for
this part ;SEMICOLON  let me do it again .PERIOD 

This is my whole problem that I have to solve .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am solving some things here some
steps I am solving .PERIOD  And then I find here there is something that has to be done which is
not very easy .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  for that I came at this point and for this I need to write a function or
might be there is a function already existing in my library ,COMMA  which has been writ
ten by somebody else ,COMMA  which I can reuse .PERIOD 
Now in that case and also say here after doing that here I can do a couple of simpler tasks
and then here I come to another point ,COMMA  which requires it to be independently solved and
written .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I need a function for that and then after that I will do some more simple
things and my task will be over say this is a situation .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  when I come here I will have to I means this program ,COMMA  which is a main tasks main
task that I have to solve .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  since we have seen the name main in our description for C
earlier ,COMMA  let me also name this to be main and I am just for nothing I am just putting some
parenthesis here .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  main is a main task that I have to do and at this point I am doing somethings and
here I need the help of this ,COMMA  now remember .PERIOD  That this function whose name is say f f 1
that can be used by my main function or somebody else main function also .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA 
when I need this to be executed with my data ,COMMA  then I must whatever data I have prepared
here that some of that I will have to pass on to this here .PERIOD 
And this will solve this subtask and then I will have to ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  a this must give back
whatever it computed to the main task and the main task will continued doing simple
things here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you see that there are 2 links ;SEMICOLON  one is going in the function ,COMMA  another is
coming out or some data that is being returned by this function .PERIOD  This is being returned by
this function .PERIOD  Then I carry out some tasks simpler tasks here and at this point I find now I
need help .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  some part of the data from here will be used by the function f 2 and that has to come
to f 2 here and f 2 will carry out the task and will return to the point here .PERIOD  Now about this
return you should observe one thing ,COMMA  that the function was called from this point ,COMMA  we call
this thing to be a function call function call with some data being passed on to this .PERIOD  And
function calls or function invocation and after invocation this function works and it
returns where does it return ?QUESTIONMARK 

It returns to the point in the main task just after the point from where it was called .PERIOD  It was
called from here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it comes here and then returns to the next point just after the after
this call .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is a calling point and this a return point .PERIOD 
Similarly for here you see that it is executing and at this point it is being called .PERIOD  And after
execution the control is returned into the immediately after the point from where it was
called .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is one important thing to understand the other important thing is that let me draw
it again here .PERIOD  I have got my main task and this is my main and here is another main task ,COMMA 
some other main task not written by me ,COMMA  but somebody else this is of mister A and this is
of mister B for mister B there is he has written another main .PERIOD 
Now mister A or mister B both will require this function f .PERIOD  Now the task the purpose of
what this task does is same for example ,COMMA  this task is computes the average of some
numbers ,COMMA  10 numbers ,COMMA  5 numbers whatever it is or may be floating point numbers ,COMMA 
integer numbers ,COMMA  whatever it is it computes the average .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  let me let me quickly rename it not keeping it wage any longer let me call it ,COMMA  average
or for a specific purpose ,COMMA  I want to write it inside the reason will be clear immediately
this computes the average .PERIOD 

Now mister a wants to use this average function for some data for 3 data he wants to
compute the average of 3 integers ,COMMA  suppose this one this one computes the average of 3
integers ,COMMA  but the integers can vary right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this also wants to find the average of 3
integers to make it simple .PERIOD 
But the in numbers for which A wants to compute the averages different from the
numbers that B will compute the average for ,COMMA  but this a v g is common to both therefore ,COMMA 
suppose the numbers that some integers say are a b and c and here this person wants to
find the average of 3 integers which are p q and r 3 variable names .PERIOD 
Now this average cannot remember p q r or a b c it will simply just like think of a box
with 3 pipes coming in and data will come in through there .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  he just names this
average for he names these pipes as x this is y and this is z .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  when this function main
wants to compute the average of a b c he must send a through the pipe x b through the
pipe y and c through the pipe z and you will get the average computed ,COMMA  and the average
will be returned from the point where it was called from this point immediately after that
it will go back clear .PERIOD 
Now when let me change the colour ,COMMA  now when the function main B ;SEMICOLON  B wants to compute
the average he wants to compute the average of p q r .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  p will be sent to the pipe x ,COMMA  q
will be sent to the pipe y ,COMMA  and r will be sent to the pipe z .PERIOD  And the average will be
computed suppose it was called from this point ,COMMA  from this point ,COMMA  this average was called .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  then it will return the to this point with the value of the average with the value of the
average whatever is computed here .PERIOD 
Therefore ,COMMA  so if this is clear then let us come to 2 more terms .PERIOD 

They are that this function main A ,COMMA  A is main was sending a ,COMMA  b ,COMMA  c to the function as
parameters we call it as parameters .PERIOD  And this function which is our average function is
not biased to a ,COMMA  it has got it knows that it needs 3 inputs and there are 3 input pipes ,COMMA  3
input positions .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  these x y z are arguments this we call as arguments alright ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  this average
when it is written it has got 3 input pipes .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we can write simply like this function
name average with 3 parameter arguments x y and z .PERIOD  Now who ever calls it we will have
to establish the mapping ,COMMA  between the parameters that it wants to pass the parameters it
wants to pass to the through the arguments .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  the connection that we had shown in the earlier diagram which was where both the
programs ,COMMA  were both the programs are accessing it .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  each of these parameters should
the parameters should be matching with this arguments .PERIOD  Let us come to this once again
say .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is main of A and here is main of B ,COMMA  I repeat what I was saying till now and this
has got p q r now ,COMMA  you must be must have realised now ,COMMA  what are these p q r ?QUESTIONMARK  When I use
this function average ,COMMA  which has got 3 arguments x y z which are nothing ,COMMA  but 3 pipes
which are arguments and when I call from some point ,COMMA  when I call this function average
then I have to pass these parameters p q r to these arguments x y z .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  p will go to x q will go to y and z r will go to z ,COMMA  on the other hand when a is calling
when a is calling ,COMMA  what is happening ,COMMA  when a is calling then a had the a b c to be passed
on to this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a goes to x ,COMMA  b goes to y and c goes to z .PERIOD  Now since now if you just think
these are 3 pipes ,COMMA  now the pipes are every pipe has got a width .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  if I want to fit smaller pipe into a bigger pipe that would not fit .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the width of
diameter of both the pipes must fit together ,COMMA  what do I mean by that ,COMMA  what I mean by that
is that whatever arguments are whatever are the types of the arguments that must match
the types of the parameters or in other words the types of the parameters also must match
the types of the arguments .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that the pipes fit there should not be any mismatch over
there .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us take little more deeper look here .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  suppose I have got a main function here I am not so much bothered about the same
types now and the main function is running and here I want to say result is average of a b
c and etcetera ,COMMA  etcetera ,COMMA  etcetera ,COMMA  etcetera and we end here .PERIOD  And let us assume that here I
have declared int a ,COMMA  b ,COMMA  c both of them are integers .PERIOD  Now we have got the function which
is average .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  this average of 3 integers can be a float .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I just write I will explain it a little later
float average x ,COMMA  y ,COMMA  z and I can say int x ,COMMA  y ,COMMA  z and whatever I am computing average here
and .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  thus this is simple you can have int sum and sum equals x plus y plus z ,COMMA  and
average is equal to x plus y plus z by 3 .PERIOD  Then I write returned ,COMMA  why do I write returned I
will come to that .PERIOD 
Now look at the 2 things a I will talk about this part a little later .PERIOD  Here I am I have
declared a b c to be integers .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in the memory for a b and c 2 bytes or 4 bytes as the
system may demand that type of that much memory has been given .PERIOD  Now when I write
here a v g ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I am invoking or calling this function a v g .PERIOD  And I am passing on
a v g requires 3 parameters x ,COMMA  y ,COMMA  z and x ,COMMA  y ,COMMA  z are all integers .PERIOD  And I could have written
there is another way of writing it that I could have written here int x int y int z that is also
possible ,COMMA  but later we will see .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  a ,COMMA  b ,COMMA  c there is a correspondence between a ,COMMA  b and c with x ,COMMA  y and z .PERIOD  And they are
matching in the type then this computation .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we come here then follow my blue line
this is being computed and ultimately the value of average is computed .PERIOD 
Look that the value is being computed in a v g which is also the name of the function .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  in a way you can say that the name of the function is just like a variable that is
holding the value ,COMMA  that is holding the value .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that average any variable that is holding a
value must have a type that is why since average of 3 integers can be a float therefore ,COMMA 
we have to assign a type to the name of the function .PERIOD 
Designating what type of value it is returning .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here we can see that it will compute
average and then there is a statement new statement that you are encountering here is
returned ,COMMA  where is it returning it is returning to the point from where it is called at is this
point .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  the average ,COMMA  suppose if the values are 1 2 and 3 then the average is 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  then 2 goes
to this a v g and that a v g is being transferred to result .PERIOD  Now if I do print result here 2
will be printed .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is to give you an idea of what is meant by in calling a function
invoking a function ,COMMA  what is meant by returning from a function ,COMMA  and what are parameters
and arguments .PERIOD 
We will see more of this in the subsequent lectures ,COMMA  but you should also understand why
we do this reasons at 2 fold as I said one is to divide or break down a complex problem
into manageable sub problems ,COMMA  and the second and test them independently ,COMMA  and the
other issue is other advantage big advantage is that once we make a thing a function ,COMMA 
which is tested we can keep it for being reused that is a very very important thing .PERIOD 
And this concept is general over different languages like ;SEMICOLON  we have got class etcetera
which we can reuse a number of times .PERIOD  And this is this idea the implementations are
varying from language to language ,COMMA  but the concept is common and is used in different
languages .PERIOD 
Thank you and we will continue with functions in the subsequent lectures .PERIOD 

We have seen what a function is ,COMMA  and why a function is required ,COMMA  what are the advantages
of using a function ?QUESTIONMARK  We have also seen ,COMMA  what is a parameter and what is an argument ,COMMA 
and the types of the parameters in the argument must match .PERIOD  Otherwise ,COMMA  the system will
of course ,COMMA  give you error and the reason is because there will be type mismatch and the
data will not be passed properly ok .PERIOD  Because this is essentially a parameter is being
assigned to an argument ok .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  in this lecture we will look at some more detail
nuisance ,COMMA  detailed points of function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  to start with let us revise what we have seen .PERIOD 

A function ;SEMICOLON  what is a function ?QUESTIONMARK  A function is a self-contained program segment .PERIOD  This
very important ;SEMICOLON  this not the whole program ,COMMA  but it is self-contained ,COMMA  and it is a program
segment ;SEMICOLON  part of a program .PERIOD  That is a main task and a part of that being executed is being
implemented by this function ,COMMA  and this self-contained because this can be independently
tested giving data and finding out ,COMMA  whether the task for which it has been designed is
actually being fulfilled or not ok .PERIOD  It carries out some specific and well-defined task .PERIOD  Now
that is the general concept of a function ,COMMA  now in C ,COMMA  any C program can consist of one or

more functions .PERIOD  At least one should be there why ,COMMA  because we need always the main right
we have seen that we need main .PERIOD 

Any C function must have a main .PERIOD  And main is nothing but a function .PERIOD  And why did we
put here this empty bracket ;SEMICOLON  because the structure of a function is always a function name
and a place for the arguments right .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  you can say that well ,COMMA  when we are starting a main function we are writing a main
function that we will do the task ,COMMA  it is not taking data from anywhere outside .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA 
why there is no argument .PERIOD  Yes ,COMMA  you are right .PERIOD  There is no argument that is why we put 2
braces and there is an empty space here ,COMMA  this is empty ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  But still it looks like a
function .PERIOD  Moreover ,COMMA  in the earlier lecture ,COMMA  we have seen that the result of the function is
returned in it is name .PERIOD  And since this is a with like a variable ,COMMA  it will have a type .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
some type like for average we found float .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this main can also have a type .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we will see later that this main can have a type .PERIOD 
We will have a set of empty arguments and the body of the function ,COMMA  and there can be
some there can be type .PERIOD  Say ,COMMA  sometimes a type can be int .PERIOD  If this main function ;SEMICOLON  that
means ,COMMA  this main function will return and integer and when we say that it does not return
anything ,COMMA  we can say also that this function is of type void ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  it does not return
any value ok ,COMMA  void .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we will see this later ,COMMA  but this is the reason why we say that every
C program must consist of one or more than one function .PERIOD  One of these functions must
be called the main ;SEMICOLON  and the execution of the program always begins by carrying out the
instructions in main .PERIOD  That is the entry points any program .PERIOD  I mean ,COMMA  I cannot say that main
will be somewhere in the middle no .PERIOD 

When I start ,COMMA  when I start ,COMMA  it must the gateway is the main .PERIOD  And then from within main ,COMMA  I
can go out and use some function f 1 ,COMMA  and from f 1 I can go out to another function f 2 ,COMMA 
another function sorry ,COMMA  another function f 2 like that .PERIOD 
But the gateway the entry should be main ;SEMICOLON  and ultimately the exit say f 2 will return here ,COMMA 
then f 1 will return here .PERIOD  Ultimately the exit will also be through main ,COMMA  alright ?QUESTIONMARK  A
function will carry out it is intended task ,COMMA  whenever it is called or invoked .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we have
encountered with this term called or invoked right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  in general ,COMMA  a function will process information ,COMMA  that is passed to it ,COMMA  from the calling
portion of the program .PERIOD  From ,COMMA  where it has from where it has been called or invoked .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA  the function will take the data ;SEMICOLON  that is ,COMMA  if some data is to be passed ,COMMA  then it will
be passed to it from the calling part .PERIOD  And it will return a single value .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what are these
points ?QUESTIONMARK  Information is passed via special identifiers ,COMMA  called arguments and parameters .PERIOD 
And the value that is returned is returned by the return statement .PERIOD  Some functions do not
return anything .PERIOD  For example ,COMMA  let us say this .PERIOD  Say ,COMMA  I am writing a function ,COMMA  say my
function .PERIOD 

It is maybe ,COMMA  it is not taking any parameters .PERIOD  Because in the body it is simply nothing
doing nothing just printing printf ,COMMA  hello ,COMMA  let us also valid function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in this case the
main function ,COMMA  where it was it was just here and it just called my function here with
nothing this also possible .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my function it goes there and does not .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I do not need
to give any return ,COMMA  but if I give a return that is also fine it does not return anything .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
this of type void it is not returning anything .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  but the control in any case it does not
return any value ,COMMA  but the control will come back here and from here it will be executed .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  there may be some functions ,COMMA  which do not return any value like it just printing some
data ok .PERIOD  That is possible for example ;SEMICOLON  I can make it even more realistic .PERIOD 

Say here main is here ,COMMA  and there is int A 5 ,COMMA  int B 6 ,COMMA  alright ?QUESTIONMARK  And here ,COMMA  I call average a
comma b ,COMMA  right .PERIOD  And here I write average int x ,COMMA  int y .PERIOD  And here I just compute average is
equal to x plus y by 2 .PERIOD  Printf a v g equals back slash ,COMMA  a v g equals ,COMMA  I am sorry ,COMMA  percentage
f back slash n comma a v g .PERIOD  That you understand .PERIOD  And I can write return or I may not
write return .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will happen ?QUESTIONMARK  This will come here 5 and 6 ,COMMA  5 will be passed on here
x will be 5 y will be 6 .PERIOD  The value will be 5 .PERIOD 5 that will be printed here .PERIOD  But I have to give
a type to this average ,COMMA  because here the average type is not defined .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have to say this
will be float average .PERIOD  Because there is some value ,COMMA  some type to this value some type to
this variable .PERIOD  Which will hold the value ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  this also possible here you can see that ,COMMA  I do
not need to write a return ,COMMA  but there is no harm ,COMMA  if I write just simply return ,COMMA  that is the
good practice ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  my return my control will come back here .PERIOD  And that is the last
statement that will be the end ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us move forward .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  some function may not
return anything the return type is specified as void .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is an example of factorial .PERIOD  We start with so ,COMMA  here first I have written the function
here ,COMMA  and then I have written the main .PERIOD 
But however ,COMMA  in whatever way we write ,COMMA  the main the program while execution we will
enter the main first ,COMMA  alright ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  so the execution will be something like this that will
enter from here main .PERIOD  It takes the variable n ,COMMA  which is an integer ;SEMICOLON  then n1 to less than 10
n plus ,COMMA  printf percentage d ok ,COMMA  and n and then factorial alright .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  factorial a now when
this factorial n is encountered ,COMMA  then we the ;SEMICOLON  this function is called .PERIOD  This function what is
doing ?QUESTIONMARK  It has got int m .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  m is the argument ,COMMA  and is being called with a parameter n ;SEMICOLON 
which has been which is being taken ;SEMICOLON  first 1 then 2 then 3 .PERIOD  Like that till it is 10 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I am taking it n ,COMMA  and then here let us see ,COMMA  what we are doing int i .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  this i this
variable i and this variable temp .PERIOD  These 2 variables are purely internal variables ;SEMICOLON  that
means ,COMMA  this variables are internal to the body of the function .PERIOD  Now each of the functions
has got a life ,COMMA  each has a life right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  factorial as long as factorial is running factorial is
live ,COMMA  and when factorial is live ,COMMA  whatever variables are defined within factorial ,COMMA  they are
live .PERIOD  As soon as we exit from factorial ,COMMA  that function is dead .PERIOD  And the variables
associated solely I repeat .PERIOD  The variables associated solely with the function also dies with
the death of the function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us see here i and temp .PERIOD  Then for i equal to one to m
temp equals temp times i .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  1 times ,COMMA  2 times ,COMMA  3 times 4 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it is what is being computed ,COMMA  1 times 2 times 3 times 4 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  like that whatever is the
value of m that is being up to that we are computing a factorial ,COMMA  alright ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  if I call it ,COMMA 
now here I have called it with n the value of n ,COMMA  alright ?QUESTIONMARK  With a value of n ,COMMA  I am calling it ,COMMA 
and I am getting the factorial .PERIOD  And the temp is being returned ,COMMA  where it is being returned ,COMMA 
this temp is being returned to factorial temp is being returned to factorial ,COMMA  and that is
being printed through this percentage d ,COMMA  alright ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA  this is being printed .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  return temp ,COMMA  because why it is different ?QUESTIONMARK  Here I did not write
return ,COMMA  because I have named it as factorial ,COMMA  and I have written temp then temp is going
to this value factorial .PERIOD  If I had not done return then ultimately ;SEMICOLON  because here I am keeping
the result in temp ;SEMICOLON  not in factorial has not been used as any variable inside the function .PERIOD 
Now when I go there ,COMMA  and suppose if I had use some other temp here ,COMMA  this temp and this
temp would have been different .PERIOD  We will come to this later ,COMMA  but this just an example of a
function being invoked .PERIOD 

We just recapitulating ,COMMA  why we need functions ?QUESTIONMARK  This term may be new to you .PERIOD  It is
modularising a program ,COMMA  is breaking down a program into small parts .PERIOD  Each part
independent part is called a module .PERIOD  That is why breaking down a big program into
smaller parts is known as modularisation .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is modularising a program .PERIOD  All variables
declared inside function are local variables .PERIOD  Very ,COMMA  very important .PERIOD  Which are declared
inside functions are local variables ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  they are known only as long as the

function is remaining running .PERIOD  As soon as the function completes it is execution .PERIOD  They
also seize to exist .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  a value variable I for example ,COMMA  can be used as an internal
variable of a function ,COMMA  and can also be used in a some other function or in the main
function .PERIOD  They will actually physically be mapped to different memory locations .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  we have also seen what parameters are .PERIOD  The parameters are communicate
information between functions ,COMMA  parameter and argument ok .PERIOD  They also become local
variables .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  parameter arguments are local variables the parameters means ,COMMA  the
arguments are also local variables .PERIOD  The benefits are divide and conquer we know we ,COMMA  we
has we have devoted one completely lecture on that ;SEMICOLON  manageable program development .PERIOD 
Software reusability ;SEMICOLON  all existing functions can use can be used as building blocks for
new programs ,COMMA  and this is another thing that you may realise later ,COMMA  that inside a function ,COMMA 
how I am implementing or how somebody has implemented ,COMMA  it may be very complicated ,COMMA 
and I need not bother about that .PERIOD 
I know what it asks for ,COMMA  what variables have to be put in through this and what output I
will get out of it ?QUESTIONMARK  Therefore ,COMMA  whatever is there inside is abstracted out from it is hidden
from it .PERIOD  The internal details are not needed ;SEMICOLON  that is ,COMMA  another big advantage of using
functions .PERIOD  And of course ,COMMA  avoid code repetition ;SEMICOLON  something which somebody has written .PERIOD 
Or say for example ,COMMA  in a main program .PERIOD  Let us take another example to understand .PERIOD 

This better say ,COMMA  I have got a program ,COMMA  in which I am doing some computations .PERIOD  Say ,COMMA 
computing the standard deviation here ,COMMA  I am computing the standard deviation here ,COMMA  and
may be .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  at both these places I write this ,COMMA  write this ,COMMA  but that is not needed .PERIOD 

If I have a function for computing standard deviation then ,COMMA  here is my main program and
there is one function for standard deviation here .PERIOD  And from this point ,COMMA  I can simply call
this get the value again continue ,COMMA  from wherever I need I can again call this ,COMMA  and I can get
the value ,COMMA  and in that way ,COMMA  I save in the number of lines of code that I write .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is
known as avoiding code repetition .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  defining a function ;SEMICOLON  how do you ?QUESTIONMARK  Now we are till now I was trying to explain you
somethings ,COMMA  now we are looking at the syntactic details of a C function .PERIOD  Now that can
vary from language to language ,COMMA  but more or less the ideas are same .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a function
definition has got 2 parts .PERIOD  The first line ,COMMA  first line and the sorry ,COMMA  the first line and the what
is happening here ?QUESTIONMARK  First line and the body of the function ok .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  what is the first line
typically ?QUESTIONMARK  What can we have in the first line ?QUESTIONMARK  First line we have got the function name .PERIOD  I
do not know why it is not coming .PERIOD  In the first line we have got the function name ,COMMA  and
the parameter list .PERIOD  I call it argument list ,COMMA  but whatever you .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  a function has got the first line .PERIOD  And we can see ;SEMICOLON  what the first line is ?QUESTIONMARK  The first line
will contain the function name ,COMMA  and a return value type ,COMMA  what type of value is being
returned .PERIOD  Followed by this is the body of the function .PERIOD  The second part is the body of the
function .PERIOD  Where there are declarations and statements .PERIOD  Some internal values can be
declared internal variables can be declared here .PERIOD  And the other statements are also here .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  that is ;SEMICOLON  so ,COMMA  this one I actually I am calling them argument .PERIOD  Some people also
call both of them to be parameters ok .PERIOD 

Now so ,COMMA  the first line contains the return value type .PERIOD  The function name and optionally a
set of comma separated arguments enclosed in parentheses .PERIOD  Like ,COMMA  say here I am defining
a function called gcd ,COMMA  greatest common deviser .PERIOD  It has got a type int ,COMMA  and has got 2
arguments .PERIOD  One is A and one is B ,COMMA  I have written the types of them in this parentheses
itself int A ,COMMA  comma int B they are comma separated .PERIOD 
The argument is possible that I can declare the arguments also on the next line .PERIOD  For
example ,COMMA  I can say instead of writing it in this way ,COMMA  I can write in this way int gcd A
comma B and in the next line before the body ,COMMA  before the before the bracket ,COMMA  probably in
earlier example I did a mistake ,COMMA  I had put the bracket inside the bracket .PERIOD  It should not be
inside the bracket .PERIOD  Immediately after that it you can write int A comma B ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA 
you are declaring that these are A and B .PERIOD  Either inside or immediately after that ,COMMA  both of
them are fine .PERIOD  Now these are called the formal arguments or some people also call it
formal parameters .PERIOD 

Now what is the body of a function ?QUESTIONMARK  The body of a function is actually a compound
statement .PERIOD  I will just take just as I had statements like for loop ok ,COMMA  or .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us take or
say while loop or if conditions ,COMMA  where I write if some condition then some statement ,COMMA  else
some statement like that .PERIOD  So now ,COMMA  this whole thing is a compound statement .PERIOD  Similarly ,COMMA 
here the entire body of the function can be assumed to be a complete compound say
statement ;SEMICOLON  where we are passing on to arguments and is giving us some value .PERIOD  Let us
look at what is being done here .PERIOD  In gcd int A ,COMMA  int B .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  from the calling function must be
I am supplying some values p and q ,COMMA  may be 2 integers of type integers ,COMMA  which are
mapping to this p and q A and B .PERIOD 

Now here you know we have seen this algorithm earlier .PERIOD  We take a variable temp .PERIOD  Now
that is now the body of the function is defined by these braces .PERIOD  Temp ,COMMA  while B is not
divided by A ,COMMA  as long as that does not happen .PERIOD  We take we divide B by A and take the
remainder ,COMMA  and then go on that classical way of finding the gcd ,COMMA  you find the reminder
and make the remainder the deviser ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  that is exactly what we are doing in a
loop .PERIOD 
Ultimately the final deviser which divides and gives us A 0 ,COMMA  that will be the when it that
will be the gcd .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that gcd now ;SEMICOLON  that gcd is coming in this A .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  I cannot here
just write simply return .PERIOD  I have to say that return A .PERIOD  And may be from the main function I
had something like say hcf is equal to gcd p comma q .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  this a is being returned to
this gcd .PERIOD  And because this g c because it was a gcd function ,COMMA  this was called and that is
why it is going to a is coming to the here ,COMMA  and then by this assignment statement that is
going to hcf .PERIOD  That is how the function is being connected ok .PERIOD  We also see what is the
body of the function ?QUESTIONMARK 

So ,COMMA  when a function is called from some other function .PERIOD  The corresponding arguments in
the function are called actual arguments or actual parameters ;SEMICOLON  that means what I am
calling parameter ,COMMA  some people call them actual parameters .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  just in the earlier
example p q were actual parameters .PERIOD  And what was there a b or x y ,COMMA  whatever was there
is a b are the are the formal parameters or formal arguments .PERIOD  Now as we had said ,COMMA  the
formal and the actual arguments must match in their data types .PERIOD  The identifiers used as
formal arguments are local .PERIOD  Not recognised outside the function .PERIOD  The names of formal
and actual arguments may differ as we have seen here ,COMMA  they are differing my actual
arguments were p q .PERIOD 

And here it is A and B of course ,COMMA  they are differing .PERIOD  Now this A and B ,COMMA  whatever it is
here ,COMMA  this A and B will not be reflected anywhere outside this function .PERIOD  Suppose ,COMMA  here
there is a main ,COMMA  the main will not get the value of A and B ,COMMA  this completely local here and
as soon as it is ends the A and B vanishes ,COMMA  A and B will no longer B available to you .PERIOD 
Same is true for temp because temp has been defined internally within this function
alright .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is a very key thing that you must understand .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  when a function is called from some other function ,COMMA  the arguments are passed
points to note that the names and of the formal and actual arguments may differ right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here I will conclude with this lecture I will conclude with this example .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here we
are computing the gcd of 4 numbers .PERIOD  In the main function ,COMMA  we have got n1 ,COMMA  n 2 ,COMMA  n 3 ,COMMA  n 4 ,COMMA 
4 values have been read here ,COMMA  you can see that they are being read as and n1 and n 2 and
n 3 and n 4 .PERIOD  They are been read .PERIOD  Now the result is ;SEMICOLON  now gcd of n1 ,COMMA  n 2 gcd of n 3 ,COMMA  n 4 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
there is one function gcd ;SEMICOLON  which takes int A int B ,COMMA  right that is what we saw .PERIOD  Now first ,COMMA 
when within this parentheses ,COMMA  we will first compute this gcd n1 and n 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a will have
n1 the value of n1 ,COMMA  b will have the value of n 2 ,COMMA  and the function will return something ,COMMA 
return A as we saw in the last example ,COMMA  return A .PERIOD  And so ,COMMA  the body of the function
ultimately ends with return a .PERIOD  And that a will come here suppose that value was 3 say .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  3 comes here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what do I have now ?QUESTIONMARK  I have got gcd of 3 comma gcd of n 3 ,COMMA  n 4 .PERIOD  So
now ,COMMA  this same function will be called with a having the value of n 3 and b having the
value of n 4 .PERIOD  And suppose I compute them ,COMMA  and I find ultimately that the gcd is 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the
5 will come here .PERIOD 
Then what happens to this ?QUESTIONMARK  Then we will compute again called gcd with 3 and 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
again here now a will have 3 ,COMMA  and b will have 5 and the return of course ,COMMA  a 3 and 5 will be
a the result the hcf of 3 and 5 is 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  return a that will come here ,COMMA  and the result will be
one .PERIOD  That is how the gcd is computed in cascading of the function calls .PERIOD  The same
function you see is being called time and again repeatedly from this single statement in
the main function .PERIOD  We will continue looking at functions more .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  in the earlier lecture ,COMMA  we have seen how a function can be invoked ,COMMA  and it returns the
values .PERIOD  As we had mentioned that it is not the case that always a function will return a
value here is an example .PERIOD 

You look at this function div 7 which says ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  the purpose of this function is to
find out whether a particular number that is passed on to it as a parameter ,COMMA  and parameter
whether that is divisible by 7 or not .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the program the code is very simple what should
we do ?QUESTIONMARK  If n is divisible by 7 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  if n modulus 7 is equal to 0 ,COMMA  then we say printf
n is divisible by 7 otherwise we print n is not divisible by 7 .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  in this case we are just printing from here straight the print out is coming printing
is coming out from here .PERIOD  The main function is only passing on the value reading
scanning reading some value of n and passing on that value of n here or may be here it is
n is the argument .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  might be the main program is reading a value num ,COMMA  and passing
that value num here .PERIOD  Now this num is also of type integer and the rest of the things are
being done by the function .PERIOD  It is testing whether it is divisible by 7 ,COMMA  if it is divisible by 7 ,COMMA 

it is printing like that otherwise its printing the other message .PERIOD  Now in this case putting
this return is optional ,COMMA  because even if I did not put the put the return when I would have
met these parentheses that is n bracket it would automatically return to the calling point .PERIOD 
However there is no harm if I put the return .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  returning control ;SEMICOLON  we have seen that how the thing is invoked by parameter passing .PERIOD 
Now returning control if nothing is returned then you can simply write return semicolon
or we can skip that and until it comes to the right brace ,COMMA  that is last right brace that is
automatically taken as the return .PERIOD  But if something is to be returned if something is to be
returned then we must put the return statement with say may be return A times B some
expression or it could be return C or it could be something like return 0 or return 1
whatever we have to do something ,COMMA  some expression and expression automatically in I
mean you know we will also capture the constants so .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  let us look at this example here you see the layout is also important here we are
first writing the function this is the function the function declaration is coming first
square of x square of an integer x and square of an integer x will also be an integer
therefore ,COMMA  the type of the function is int as you can see here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is this whole thing is
the function declaration ,COMMA  then starts the body of the function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here the function
declaration consists of the name of the function ,COMMA  and the parameter that is x of type
integer and this int ,COMMA  here is a return data type what the type of the data type that will be
returned .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these 3 together make the function declaration .PERIOD 
Next we are coming to the body of the function int y what is that that is a temporary
variable temporary variable why I am calling it temporary ?QUESTIONMARK  Because it lives as long as
this function is active ,COMMA  as soon as the function is function ends the role the definition of
this y is also lost .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here you see we will come to that later that here you see that this is
an internal variable ,COMMA  here I am computing the square y assigned x times x ,COMMA  and I am
returning y .PERIOD  I am returning y and after returned that y vanishes y where is y returning to ?QUESTIONMARK 
Wherever they square has been called now here you see here is a sum of square the what
is main doing now let us come to main .PERIOD  Main has got some variables a b and sum of
square is another variable .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  printf give a and b I am reading a and b .PERIOD  Now I am calling
this function twice first with the parameter a next with the parameter b and a and b how I
mean in sequence goes to this argument x and the square of a is computed .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  return y
will return first here a square .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we get a square here then this is called and y is

returned here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we get b square and then these 2 are added and we get sum of square
alright and then we are printing the sum of square .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you need to you can also try to see
what is a flow of data in such cases alright let us move ahead .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  these are the parameters passed and here are the ,COMMA  here is the argument you can see
that .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  invoking a function call here the same thing what is happening when a the thing
that I just now explained .PERIOD 

When I am saying now let us see what happens to the variables assume that the value of
a that has been read here is 10 alright then square of a means square of 10 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  10goes to
x ,COMMA  right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  a is 10 here that goes to x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x becomes 10 ,COMMA  now we compute y which is 10 times
10 I am getting y .PERIOD  Y is becoming hundred right now this hundred is coming here actually
this arrow is a little wrong here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will be actually coming to this point clear next
suppose .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  in that case ,COMMA  similarly it will be for b ,COMMA  if b was some value that is the how then x
suppose b was 7 then x will get 7 and then y will be 49 ,COMMA  and 49 will come to that square
of b .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  100 plus 49 will now be added and will be kept as the sum of square .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in the
earlier example you could see that in the earlier example the first the function was return
and then the main now let us look at go ahead function definition .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  we have seen that a function name preceded by return value type and declaration
statement and then the function body I am repeating certain things variables can be
declare declared inside the blocks the blocks can be nested ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  there can
multiple blocks function cannot be defined inside another function this must be clearly
understood a function cannot be defined within another function and returning of control
the control will have to be returned as we have seen ,COMMA  if nothing returned then return we
have already seen that if something is returned then return that expression .PERIOD 

Here again another example of function ,COMMA  the more examples you do the better you will
understand .PERIOD  Here the function as the name implies you see its always better to use
meaningful names of functions some of digits of n .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if there be number like 125 then I
am trying to extract this digits 1 plus 2 plus 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that will be 8 that is what my program
wants to do .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  initially sum is equal to 0 while n is not equal to 0 ,COMMA  sum plus remainder .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  125 if I divide by 10 ,COMMA  then I will have 12 here and remainder is 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  sum plus 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
sum becomes 5 clear .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  then we find out the device dividend that is 12 and again divide that by 10 ,COMMA  we get
2 to be the remainder .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we take sum to be 5 plus 2 and so and so forth .PERIOD  Ultimately I
am getting the sum .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  return sum this another example of a function ;SEMICOLON  here you can see
that this n is coming as a parameter all these sum ;SEMICOLON  sum is a an internal variable and will
not have life beyond the body of the program .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here you see sum of digits is a function name int is a return data type ,COMMA  parameter list
is that local variables is sum .PERIOD  Sum is a local variable and return statement is return sum
clear all these we have already discussed ,COMMA  this is merely a division ;SEMICOLON  and here you can see
that the return can have an expression here only a variable is an expression .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  we come to a very important concept ,COMMA  which I was mentioning in the passing that
the life of an intern variable internal to a function exists as long as the function is live as
long as the function is active .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  that formally is known is called the scope of the variable or the variable scope .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
let us look here there is an interesting program .PERIOD  Now here you see my entry point is the
main ,COMMA  but even before that ,COMMA  I have declared a variable int A ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  this A is a global
variable that means ,COMMA  it is there always .PERIOD  Suppose it is A value 100 then it remains this this
is retained .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us keep this and let us see what happens .PERIOD  Now I am entering main and
I have assigned A to 1 now ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  now inside this function inside this main I have
got mains A which is another A let me write it m is it visible let me do it in a better way .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  there is one A ,COMMA  I am calling that A g that is this A ,COMMA  is A g that is the global A and
suppose that is 100 .PERIOD  Now this is another a which is defined in the main .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the function
this will be live inside main .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let me call it A m alright .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  A becomes 1 here as
I come here a 1 ,COMMA  then I am calling my proc a function my proc from here it comes to my
proc and suppose my proc has got another A here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let me call that to be A x just for
understanding that it is of my proc or let me call it let me call it of the function right ;SEMICOLON  so ,COMMA 
AF .PERIOD  Now that is initialised to 2 now you see how many different as I have ?QUESTIONMARK  Multiple as
now inside this block I initialise another A to be 3 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is another A that means ,COMMA  this
one is not being disturbed A is 2 and while A is 2 I am making another a because here I
am declaring you see this is a pure declaration int A .PERIOD  If I had just written A ,COMMA  if I had just
written A assigned 3 ,COMMA  then this A would be assigned 3 ,COMMA  but here I have declared another
A int A .PERIOD 
Therefore there is another A coming within this y while block that I am calling AB ,COMMA  and
that is becoming 3 .PERIOD  Now I am printing A ,COMMA  which here will be printed the inner most the
current A that means ,COMMA  3 will be printed then I break ;SEMICOLON  break means what ?QUESTIONMARK  I come out of the
while loop we have learned break .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we come out of the while loop and then I print a
which is so ,COMMA  as soon as I break out of this this is gone no longer live .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I am coming here now which a is in my scope which a is in my scope ,COMMA  my scope is
this I am within this function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this A .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that will be printed here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  2 or there was

some back slash n I am ignoring them that will come one after another and then I come
out of this its over .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I go to this main function go back sorry not here I am sorry it
should go back to this point ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I will now execute print which a is in my scope
now I have come out of this come out of this function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the its scope is also gone .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
the scope of this function main is now live .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is the value one ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  that will be
printed ;SEMICOLON  that is how the things will be printed .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we will repeat it if necessary ,COMMA  but let us
try to see the execution .PERIOD 

Now so ,COMMA  if I first do it then this one will be printed a assigned 3 next that is gone .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
here A will be this will be assigned A assigned 2 ,COMMA  then I will go up there and the A that is
in the scope of this function that will be assigned and then .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that will be assigned ok .PERIOD 
You see although I declared a global A internally when I declare some other A ,COMMA  this
global A I have I look here a point has to be seen .PERIOD  I declared A ,COMMA  a global A here A g that
was declared .PERIOD  Here I have assigned to A ,COMMA  I have not declared another A ,COMMA  I have not
written int A I have simply written a assigned 1 that means ,COMMA  the a that was there is
already existing globally that has been assigned one .PERIOD 
But when I come here and I am declaring int A internally inside this process ,COMMA  another A
is created which is the A of the function and that is assigned by with 2 not this one ,COMMA  they
are 2 distinct entities .PERIOD  Now again here I have declared another A .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  since I have
declared another A ,COMMA  this is the A of this while loop might be and that is becoming 3 and

accordingly the corresponding whenever I say print which one will be printed ,COMMA  which one
will be printed will be the one that is within its scope this a is in the scope of this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
that was printed this and gone this A was is in the scope of this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  printed and gone and
this A is in the scope of this and this is printed .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is known as the scope of
variables ok .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if we summarise functions ,COMMA  you can see this I do not know how much is visible .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
main function I am calling of a function factorial ,COMMA  and we have already seen that and then
the function is having different its a self contained programme ,COMMA  which has got its definite
name function definition whether type of the argument is also specified .PERIOD  Now main is a
function and here I am calling a function ,COMMA  I am actually calling a function by name
calling by name and is a returned data type repeating that the function name is there the
parameter is there and the return statement .PERIOD 
And the other variables like temp and all those are local variables you are repeating .PERIOD 

Now some points is a function cannot be defined within another function ,COMMA  which we have
told ,COMMA  but I am repeating it again all function definitions must be disjoint ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I
cannot define one function within another nested function calls are allowed what is
meant by nested function call nested function call means that suppose here is a main
program going on .PERIOD 

I call a function this is function say F 1 ,COMMA  and this was my main from some point in the
function in order to solve this problem F 1 ,COMMA  I may call another function F 2 this is nesting

calling ,COMMA  but not defined they are defined separately F 1 defined separately ,COMMA  F 2 defined
separately ,COMMA  m defined separately .PERIOD  Now from F 2 ,COMMA  I may call another function F 3 and F 3
completes F 2 has called F 3 because of some reason .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that problem reason is
answered I mean for some value of a some computation that computation has been done
from here it returns to the point from where it was called .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this a return point .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  is it
clear or should I use some other caller for the return point is it necessary .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am not
getting the colour .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let me use the existing colour whatever was there .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let it go .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
from here now the colour has come .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can show the return here I am returning ,COMMA  but
then again I am continuing with this function .PERIOD 
And when F 2 is over ,COMMA  then I again return to F 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it was called F 1 called F 2 for some
purpose that purpose is solved .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I return here and then F 1 continues again in its
whatever it has doing and F 1 was called by main for some particular reason when that
purpose is served ,COMMA  then we return to this point and then main continues right and
ultimately main ends with this bracket .PERIOD  Now here this is known as nesting ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I
nesting of calls .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I have made a call ,COMMA  and from that call I can make another call from there I can make
another call .PERIOD  But the point to point to note is that all this functions must be independently
and separately defined they cannot be defined one among the other .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  nested function
calls are allowed A calls B ,COMMA  B calls C as I have shown m calls F 1 ,COMMA  F 1 calls F 2 ,COMMA  F 2 calls
F 3 like that it can happen .PERIOD  The function called last will be the first to return ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA 
we have seen that in our earlier slide that we go back to the F 4 from F4 I return to F 2
and like that and .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a function can call also call itself either directly or in a cycle ,COMMA  we
will see this separately what is meant by that .PERIOD  A calls B this is this can be in 2 ways one
is that say A calls B ,COMMA  B calls C ,COMMA  C calls back A that is possible like say here if we see that .PERIOD 

Main was running it called F 1 ,COMMA  F 1 called F 2 and then F 2 can again call F 1 and then
this call ultimately for this call the return has to come here and ultimately it will have to
return here etcetera .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this part will have to see separately that is its a function one
function is calling another and that can be in a cycle F 1 calling F 2 ,COMMA  F 2 calling F 1 it can
happen or recursion means say a particular function F 1 calling itself a number of times
that requires a special attention and a special discussion that we have to carry out we will
do that in subsequently .PERIOD 
But right now just it is remember that these calls can be in a cycle or it can be called to
itself which is a recursion .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  we have got some math library functions ,COMMA  which perform common mathematical
calculations and I do not remember whether in an earlier class I mistakenly said that ,COMMA  I
had mistakenly I do not remember exactly whether I did that or not that you need to
include just as we include math dot s t d i o dot h ,COMMA  similarly we have to include math dot
h .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  just as we include s t d i o dot h if we use some mathematical functions which are
already available in the c library ,COMMA  we have to include math dot h .PERIOD  I do not remember
whether while first introducing the square root function ,COMMA  I have might be mistakenly I
wrote math dot leap that is a library function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  dot leap if I had said that that you
should ignore it is math dot h include math dot h and .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here there is an important thing ,COMMA  when I compile you known any function that we any
program that we write we have to compile it in order to get and executable code .PERIOD  Now in
your exercises you must have done by now the typically you compile a c program like
this .PERIOD 

C c myprog dot c right ,COMMA  but if you use some mathematical library in your function then
you should write c c minus l m myprog dot c or ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  link to the mathematical
library you compile first you compile now you see .PERIOD 

What is happening is the mathematical libraries are here say some square root function
somebody has written for you and that is in the c library alright may be some other
function like to upper ,COMMA  which converts from lower case to upper case all these things are
there .PERIOD  Now to upper is the separate library where square root is the math library .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if in
your function you if in your program you write you refer to the square root some
mathematical library ,COMMA  then you must do this why because purely myprog dot c will
generate some object code alright object code .PERIOD 
Now the code for this has to be linked to this has to linked .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that your ultimately the
fool executable code also takes into this account this code link to this code will be
forming your executable code because the square root you will need anyway at that time
of running it right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here it has shown minus l m at the later also c c program name
and then link with the mathematical library format for calling the functions ,COMMA  forget about
this let us make it for the time being ignore this just say percentage f function name .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
this is point number 1 ,COMMA  there are many mathematical library functions in order to include
in order to use them we have to include immediately after s t d i o dot h hash include
math dot h and we must use this give this linking command .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  when we call the function ,COMMA  the function name argument if multiple arguments then
we can use a comma separated list say for example ,COMMA  printf some format the square root
nine or there is only one .PERIOD  Argument not much arguments may be constant variables or
expressions all math now this is important .PERIOD  All math functions return the data type
double this is important you should keep in mind this are for c ,COMMA  all the math functions are
returning the data type double .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in order to make it compatible with the variable where
you except the value returned by the math function that should also be double arguments
may be constants or variables .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here are some examples of math library function like finding the cos of some angle x
finding the sin thus all this functions are known as a sin a cos a tan inverse tan (Refer
Time:33:41) tan ceiling function floor function .PERIOD  Floor function means it finds the greatest
largest integral value that is less than x ,COMMA  suppose some say 200 .PERIOD 56 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the largest integral
value is 2 hundred that is the floor function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  cos a cos is finding the cos of an angle in
degree whereas ,COMMA  a cos sorry cos is for finding the cosine of angle in radian now there is
no point in memorising them as and when you need them look at the manual look at the
book and very soon you will get a custom to the different library which are available for
c and .PERIOD 

We will come back to this in the next function ,COMMA  next lecture about some more very well-
known functions which you have already encountered with and then we will proceed further with recursion .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 

In the earlier lectures ,COMMA  we have looked at functions and we will still be looking at
functions .PERIOD  We have also looked at the library functions and just to recapitulate that ,COMMA 
whenever we are using some library functions in our program ,COMMA  then we have to some
mathematical library functions ,COMMA  then we have to hash include math dot h .PERIOD  And while we
link it ,COMMA  we have while we compile it ,COMMA  we will also have to link it with the maths library
with the option minus l m as we have seen .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  today ,COMMA  since now ,COMMA  we have got an idea of what functions are .PERIOD  Let us have a relook
at our old friends scanf and printf ,COMMA  which we were using a number of times .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  scanf
and printf are nothing but functions .PERIOD  These are also some library functions and those are
included whenever we use include s t d I o dot h .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  you see scanf and printf being
functions when we enter data ,COMMA  let us look at this structure .PERIOD 

We write scanf followed by some parameters .PERIOD  We have also seen that ,COMMA  a function is a
function is nothing but ,COMMA  something like f ;SEMICOLON  say ,COMMA  function name followed by some

parameters .PERIOD  Here ,COMMA  this scanf is that function name and the parameters are the control
string ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  say for scanf you have got something like percentage d and then x
alright .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is the control string and these are the arguments alright .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  both of these
are arguments to the functions scanf .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  scanf is nothing but a function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  whenever in my program ,COMMA  suppose I am writing a
program and here I use scanf with some parameters .PERIOD  Like this ,COMMA  then it is nothing but a call
to a system function .PERIOD  A system function which actually does the task of reading the data
from the input input device .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  a control string refers to typically the data types of the arguments .PERIOD  We have seen
percentage d percentage f etcetera .PERIOD  And the arguments are pointers to data items in
memory .PERIOD  These arguments in scanf are what are ;SEMICOLON  the typical arguments in scanf ?QUESTIONMARK  They
are say ,COMMA  whenever I use scanf ,COMMA  say percentage d then and a or something like that right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA  this and is nothing but an address of the variable a .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in my memory ,COMMA  wherever
the variable a is ,COMMA  the variable a the compiler is allocated this memory location ,COMMA  for the
variable a and I am passing the address of that so ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  it is a pointer pointing to
some address or a pointer that is pointing to this particular location in the case of scanf ,COMMA 
ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is why ,COMMA  it said the arguments these arguments arg 1 arg 2 arg n are
representing nothing but pointers to data items in the memory  .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the example ,COMMA  a typical example is ,COMMA  say ,COMMA  percentage d percentage f percentage c to
which is nothing but the control string ,COMMA  it is designating that and a ;SEMICOLON  a is a is an integer and
and a is a pointer to a .PERIOD  And average is a floating-point number .PERIOD  And and average is a
pointer to average .PERIOD  And type is a character type variable .PERIOD  And and type is ,COMMA  why is type a
character type variable ?QUESTIONMARK  Because ,COMMA  I have put in here and c since I have put in here and c
that tells me that this type is a character type variable and and type and type is a pointer
to the variable type .PERIOD 
The control string consists of individual groups of characters with one-character group
for each input data item .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is one-character group for this a type .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  percentage we
have seen that percentage sign means ,COMMA  is a conversion character .PERIOD 

The commonly used conversion characters we have already seen some of them ,COMMA  these are
known to us ,COMMA  percentage d is for decimal or integers ,COMMA  percentage f for floating point
numbers ,COMMA  percentage c for single character ,COMMA  percentage s is a string .PERIOD  Whenever ,COMMA  I am
reading something variable as a string ,COMMA  we have discussed that in that case ,COMMA  we are
reading the string using percentage s and that is a string is always terminated by null
character .PERIOD 
Similarly ,COMMA  percentage x denotes that ,COMMA  the number that I am reading is a hexadecimal
character .PERIOD  Hexadecimal means decimal is with a base ten ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  0 to 9 are my
elements .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  all the numbers I have ,COMMA  I am describing using 0 to 9 .PERIOD  That is my alphabet
set .PERIOD  Whereas ,COMMA  in the case of hexadecimal ,COMMA  the base is 16 and so ,COMMA  base being 16 ,COMMA  I have got
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 .PERIOD  These 10 numbers followed by A for 10 ,COMMA  B for 11 ,COMMA  C 12 ,COMMA  D 13 ,COMMA  E 14
and F 15 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  up to that ,COMMA  0 to 15 ,COMMA  I can have .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in a 16 ,COMMA  when I work with a base 16 and that is
known as hexadecimal .PERIOD  Now so ,COMMA  so you can just establishing a similarity ,COMMA  analogy with
our binary numbers system that we have seen ,COMMA  we can have ,COMMA  say ,COMMA  a number A B .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  A B is a string .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the position string position weights are ,COMMA  first position is 16 to
the power 0 ,COMMA  second position is 16 to the power 1 ,COMMA  third position is 16 to the power 2 ,COMMA  like
that .PERIOD  In the case of binary ,COMMA  we had the first position way ,COMMA  it was 2 to the power 0 ,COMMA  2 to the
power 1 ,COMMA  2 to the power 2 ,COMMA  like that right .PERIOD  Now and each of these positions can be filled
up in the case of binary by 0 and 1 ,COMMA  but here ,COMMA  in the case of hexadecimal ,COMMA  it can be filled
up with any of these 0 to a 0 to F .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  A B ,COMMA  when I say ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  B is what in decimal B is 11 12 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  12 times what is
the weight of this position 16 to the power 0 plus A is 11 sorry ,COMMA  sorry ,COMMA  sorry ,COMMA  sorry ,COMMA  I am ,COMMA 
I am ,COMMA  I am sorry .PERIOD  this is 10 .PERIOD  10 to sorry let me correct that ,COMMA  A is 10 and B is 11 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is 11
into 16 to the power 0 and 10 times 16 to the power 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  how much is that coming to ?QUESTIONMARK 
160 plus 11 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is the number 171 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  if I had to represent 171 in binary ,COMMA  I would
have required much more number of bits right .PERIOD 
And since it is hexadecimal ,COMMA  another so ,COMMA  here we using hexadecimal ,COMMA  I am being able to
do that using 2 hexadecimal bits ,COMMA  which we can call hex x ,COMMA  but ,COMMA  let us see A B .PERIOD 

A being 10 and B being 11 ,COMMA  in binary what would that be B is 11 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  8 2 1 ,COMMA  this
is 11 and 10 is 8 2 that is all .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I would have required 4 bits for representing 171 ,COMMA  which
I am representing using hex x alright .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is a hexadecimal integer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I if I print
something in hex in this in this format ,COMMA  then it would be printed like 171 will be printed
as A B .PERIOD  Otherwise ,COMMA  it will be printed as in the binary number or in the decimal number .PERIOD  If
I do it with percentage d will be printed like this .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  it was a brief introduction to hexadecimal numbers ,COMMA  but that you can read up
yourself .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us proceed .PERIOD 

We can also specify the maximum field width of a data item .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  this is something I
had purposefully evaded till now ,COMMA  just to not to make the things complicated .PERIOD  I want that
you first get a custom to the normal features of c .PERIOD  But now ,COMMA  we are in a now ,COMMA  I think you
have you are in a position where you can write programs .PERIOD  Here ,COMMA  I am introducing the
notion of field width .PERIOD  A data will be printed within a width ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  So many positions will
be given to that number .PERIOD  data item the number indicating the field width before the
conversion character .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA  let us make it clear .PERIOD  For example ,COMMA  percentage 3 d ,COMMA  percentage 5 d for A and
B ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  A will be expected to be of sorry ;SEMICOLON  A will be expected to be of 3 positions ;SEMICOLON 
say ,COMMA  percentage it is 3 d decimal 171 whereas ,COMMA  B will be 5 d .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  there will be 5 positions
for this 1 2 3 4 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  may be 52732 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  if I want to print 171 or read 171 using the
format 5 d ,COMMA  then what should I print ?QUESTIONMARK  I should print a sorry I should provide the data for
the 5 fields .PERIOD  I should put it blank ,COMMA  blank or 0 0 then 171 assuming ,COMMA  it is right justify
alright .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this is the width .PERIOD  This is the width that we are talking about .PERIOD  We can specify how
many what is the when I am reading what is the format of the data ?QUESTIONMARK  How many widths ,COMMA 
how many positions it is taking for as the data ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK 

So ,COMMA  say for example ,COMMA  if I have .PERIOD 171 5 3 2 then 7 ,COMMA  then ,COMMA  if I read it ,COMMA  the first data if field is
feed is this ,COMMA  I type to the keyboard and if it is in percentage 3 d it will be fine ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I
will read that .PERIOD 

Again ,COMMA  now coming to writing now ,COMMA  this printf is also a system function .PERIOD  Just like scanf
printf is also a system function and here also ,COMMA  since you know already ,COMMA  how do you write
printf ?QUESTIONMARK  I write printf using a control string within the double code and then followed by

this number of arguments .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the same thing will hold here .PERIOD  Control string refers to the
string containing formatting information and data types of the arguments to be output  .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  here while printing the arg 1 arg 2 ,COMMA  these are the representing the individual data
items .PERIOD  In the case of scanf ,COMMA  they were pointers to the data items .PERIOD  Here ,COMMA  they are individual
data items that I have told you earlier .PERIOD  That is why ,COMMA  we use ampersand a ampersand b in
the case of scanf .PERIOD  But in the case of printf ,COMMA  we just write a b ,COMMA  ok .PERIOD  Because ,COMMA  this a b are
directly referring to the variables the data items .PERIOD  The conversion characters are the same
as scanf .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  let us look at some examples .PERIOD  Printf the average of a and b is avg and that avg is
percentage f ,COMMA  you can see that right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  avg is a float .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  I could have also done this that ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  this is nothing but ,COMMA  there is a control string  ,COMMA 
here you see ,COMMA  I have said that 3 d 3 d 5 d .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a will be printed .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  when do you printed a
will be printed ,COMMA  there is no new line here you can see .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  a b and a times b plus 2 will be printed side by side .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a will be printed on 3 fields
like ,COMMA  say 171 ,COMMA  b b will be printed on 3 next 3 there is no space given .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this will be b 6 3
2 and the expression .PERIOD  Here a times b plus 2 will have have 5 spaces 5 positions given
now ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA  if my data for result for a was 1712 ,COMMA  then only this much will be printed .PERIOD 
Then the rest will be left out ,COMMA  ok .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here you see for the percentage f .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  for this ,COMMA  I think it is not very difficult to understand .PERIOD  You can read them in the any
textbook .PERIOD  It is clearly discussed in most of the textbooks .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I recommend you to go
through these formats and as you practice ,COMMA  you will keep that in mind ,COMMA  but just to tell you
this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  floating point number will have 2 parts ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  One is the integer part and the
other is a decimal part .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  suppose here ,COMMA  when I say 7 .PERIOD 2 f x is a floating-point number ,COMMA 
which is being printed in the formats 7 .PERIOD 2 f .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this entire width is 7 positions and the 2
positions here are kept for the decimal .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these 2 are kept for the decimal and we
imagine ,COMMA  we will have a decimal point here and the rest 5 will be 5 will be for the integer
part .PERIOD 
For y what will happen ?QUESTIONMARK  For y the total field is 5 ,COMMA  out of which ,COMMA  so total field is 5 out of
which only 1 position is kept after the fraction .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here ,COMMA  I assume the this point .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA  there are 4 positions to represent an integer and one position to deserve represent
a fraction .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if my result was 101 .PERIOD 52 in this format ,COMMA  if I print that ,COMMA  then I will get 0101
or this 0 can be may not be printed .PERIOD 

Many more options are available .PERIOD  You can read from the book and we will do this later .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  coming to a very important concept ah ,COMMA  that is ,COMMA  function prototypes .PERIOD  This is
possibly new name that you are getting .PERIOD  What are these prototypes ?QUESTIONMARK  Now ,COMMA  we are going
to write functions and those functions ,COMMA  one of the functions which must be there is the
main function ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  Typically ,COMMA  people write first the main function and then the first the
functions and then the main function ,COMMA  but you are free not to do that also .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  usually a
function is defined before it is called .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  typically ,COMMA  what we do is ,COMMA  when our main our

programs starts ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  we start the program starts from here ,COMMA  we define of we write a
function with some parameters here and the body of the function is here ,COMMA  then ,COMMA  we write ,COMMA 
say ,COMMA  main .PERIOD  And inside main ,COMMA  I call f 1 this assigned to some variable x like that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is
the typically some what we do alright .PERIOD  After I did ,COMMA  this include s t d I o dot h .PERIOD  I started
with the function first ;SEMICOLON  that is ,COMMA  one option now ,COMMA  but always ,COMMA  that is not done .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  main in that case ,COMMA  if I define the functions first the functions ,COMMA  that I am going to use ,COMMA  I
have thought about that I have designed them .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first I write those functions and after
that ,COMMA  I write the main function .PERIOD  In that case ,COMMA  the main is the last function in the program .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  in that case ,COMMA  the compiler ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  I have got my program here ,COMMA  entire program here .PERIOD  And I
have defined the function f 1 here .PERIOD  I have defined function f 2 here .PERIOD  And when I write
main here and in main ,COMMA  I refer to f 1 f 2 whichever whenever is this required .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  let us look at the compiler think of yourself to be the compiler .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  if you had
started compiling the main first and you would have come to f and f 2 ,COMMA  then you would
wonder what is that f 1 and f 2 .PERIOD  No variables are defined right ?QUESTIONMARK  You would have taken
just like ,COMMA  if you had written x in the main ,COMMA  some function f 1 some function like f 1 a b
right .PERIOD  Then ,COMMA  this f 1 is not recognised ;SEMICOLON  I mean you do not know about that here ,COMMA  but if you
write it before ,COMMA  the compiler will actually start looking from the beginning of the page ,COMMA 
beginning of the program .PERIOD  You will understand ,COMMA  a function has been defined here ,COMMA  I
understand that function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I know that and the I know what this function does it

compiles that and f 2 also .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  when it comes to in this reduction ,COMMA  when it comes to the
main and finds f 1 and f 2 ,COMMA  it already knows that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  there is no problem .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  easy for the
compiler to identify the functions ,COMMA  when it scans through the file this a file right ,COMMA  the
whole thing is a file

However ,COMMA  always that is not done many programmers prefer a top down approach ,COMMA  where
I will first define main and then I will put the functions ,COMMA  but then what will happen to the
compiler ?QUESTIONMARK  The compiler if it starts with main ,COMMA  it is starting from the beginning and if it
encounters f 1 or f 2 in the body of the main function ,COMMA  then it will get confused what is it
just like ,COMMA  if I had got a variable x being used and it is not defined there been error
because ,COMMA  I do not know what this x is ,COMMA  what type it is right ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  I have to declare that
before there .PERIOD  Similarly ,COMMA  for functions there must be some way to tell the compiler that is
the function and for that function prototypes are used function prototypes are used .PERIOD 

Let us look at this needed we the function comes later .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  function prototypes let us
look at  .PERIOD  Are usually written at the beginning of the program ahead of any other functions
including main ,COMMA  say for example ,COMMA  this is a prototype .PERIOD  This is a prototype ,COMMA  int g c d int a int
b ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a and b are the parameters and g c d is a function of return type int .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I know
just by this prototype by this ,COMMA  I know the basic whatever is a body whatever is a body of
g c d ,COMMA  I know it is interface ,COMMA  I know it is input output .PERIOD  What is it is input output ?QUESTIONMARK  There
will be some a coming some parameter .PERIOD 
There are 2 parameters internally ,COMMA  they are named as a and b .PERIOD  I also know that ,COMMA  this is an
integer and this is also is integer and I know that it is name is g c d and I also know that ,COMMA 
it is output is an integer .PERIOD  Whatever is in between ,COMMA  I am not bothered about right now this
much I know .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will expect whenever g c d will come ,COMMA  I will allocate 2 integers space
for that and one return facility should be there .PERIOD 
Similarly ,COMMA  let us look at the second one div 7 int number .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the prototype tells that ,COMMA  it is a function .PERIOD  It is name is div 7 .PERIOD  You can guess div 7
means ,COMMA  is testing the divisibility by 7 and there is one integer that is being fed and that
integers name is number and void is a type ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  it is not returning anything .PERIOD  May
be ,COMMA  it is printing something from here ,COMMA  it just checks takes a number ;SEMICOLON  it sees whether it is
divisible by 7 and prints it here divisible by 7 ,COMMA  not divisible by 7 ,COMMA  whatever you know .PERIOD 
How to find divisibility by 7 ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  you take the number and find the mod of that with 7
and if this is equal to 0 ,COMMA  then divisible by 7 ,COMMA  otherwise not .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is in the body of the
function and here ,COMMA  we just do the printing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am not returning anything to the calling
function .PERIOD  That is why ,COMMA  this is known as void .PERIOD  Void is a valid type .PERIOD 

Note the semicolon now here this very important .PERIOD  Whenever for hash include the s t d I o
dot h ,COMMA  I did not give a semicolon .PERIOD  But whenever I am declaring a function of function
prototype ,COMMA  I have to give a semicolon just as I had given a semicolon when I declare
something like int x semicolon .PERIOD 
Similarly ,COMMA  here ,COMMA  this semicolon is very important .PERIOD  It just like a declaration .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the
argument names can be different ,COMMA  but it is I mean it is a good practice to use the same
names in the function .PERIOD  Now ah ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  what is being said here is that ,COMMA  although I am using
here ,COMMA  showing that A and A ,COMMA  but when I am actually writing the function later say ,COMMA  sorry .PERIOD 

When I am writing the function later ,COMMA  when I wrote later on int g c d ,COMMA  I can make ,COMMA  let us
space ,COMMA  sorry I can write int g c d int x comma int y that is also possible ok .PERIOD  Because ,COMMA  my
prototype just said that ,COMMA  2 integer places .PERIOD  Now actually ,COMMA  I can change the name ,COMMA  change
the name of the place ,COMMA  but that is not that important .PERIOD  I mean that is not I mean ,COMMA  usually it
is better if we can keep both of them .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is a function prototype example .PERIOD  I will continue with this in the next lecture .PERIOD  I
will discuss this and we will move to some other important feature of function like
parameter passing in the next lecture onwards .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  in the last lecture ,COMMA  we have discussed about function prototype .PERIOD  Before moving to
some other topic let us look at an example of function prototype and so that we can
understand it better .PERIOD 

Here you see here is a program were I have got a function n c r ,COMMA  n choose r and another
function fact .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  the functions are actually little later here you see n choose r is like
this standard n choose r that you do .PERIOD  Here that is a factorial n by factorial r ,COMMA  so factorial n
divided by factorial r into factorial n minus r that we know from our school right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that
is one function that is one function .PERIOD 
The other function is the factorial .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here is another function ,COMMA  this is one function this
another function .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  look at the beauty of this function this function is in a simple one
return statement I have written everything .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here you see the body of the function is
merely a computation of an expression fact 10 divided by fact r divided by n ,COMMA  fact n
minus r and this will be computed and that will be returned as an integer .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  what will
be the input the input will be n and the r both of them are integers .PERIOD 

Another point to note here is this function itself this function itself when is running first
say I get into this function and I tried to compute the return value ,COMMA  first I find fact n and
from here I am calling another function that is the factorial function and the factorial
function is taking only one input one integer n and based on that it is computing the
factorial .PERIOD  Computing the factorial you must be remembering by now ,COMMA  or knowing by
now ,COMMA  that is I am starting with 1 and 1 times 2 times 3 etcetera I am going on doing and
that is what is being done here temp is 1 and temp is equal to temp times i ,COMMA  this is wrong
this should be small i ,COMMA  temp is temp times i ,COMMA  whatever the i value is ,COMMA  1 times 1 ,COMMA  1 times 2 ,COMMA 
1 times 3 it goes on till i reaches n and then i return temp .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  the point to that you know ,COMMA  this will this thing you know .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is being done here
is when I am computing this function then I come to this I call this function return temp ,COMMA 
I return here and then I move here and again I find again I call to this fact again ,COMMA  this time
with the different parameter r and so again fact r is computed after this is computed
second time when I return back here .PERIOD  And then I again call this fact using n minus r ,COMMA  so
just to make the things clear .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the first time I am calling this from here and returning
back here ,COMMA  second time I am calling this from here the same thing and returning back
here and third time I am calling from here and returning back here .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  for the third call I am ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  here is one n and that this n and here what I am passing I
am passing n minus r ,COMMA  I am first computing this and that is being passed here and that is

being computed .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here you see it is an example of nested call this was called from the
main and this in turns call I mean call another function and in this way it goes on .PERIOD  That is
about the beauty of these two functions .PERIOD  But now ,COMMA  here is my main ,COMMA  main function here is
my main function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the compilers comes from in this way and recognises at this point
that ok ,COMMA  n c r is a function how does it know it looks like int .PERIOD  But how does it recognise
that it is a function ?QUESTIONMARK  It recognises n c r to a function because of this parameter argument
list .PERIOD 

Here it is said int r there are two integers coming in as parameters next it understands
that fact is also a function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  its expecting to encounter n c r and facts somewhere down
the line and proceeds here it takes m and n ,COMMA  reads m and n ,COMMA  then it is in a loop where it is
calling n c r .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is series you can understand n c r is computing some with some value
i initially 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is basically n c 1 plus n c 2 plus n c 3 plus etcetera it will go up to m
all right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is what is being computed here and so from here a call is made to this .PERIOD 
And as we have seen earlier while this is being executed this one is calling here this is
returning back here then again this one .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  we are making a journey in this line .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
this one is calling this and we are returning back here as we have seen just now .PERIOD  Now
ultimately when this entire thing is computed then we will come to this ,COMMA  last bracket here
sorry I should not this bracket here ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  it is a end of n c r .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I had called n c r

from here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will return back here and will whatever n c r value is that will be added
to sum and that will go to this sum and then will proceed in this way I hope this clear .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  here I have not written n c r .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I could have I could have written this earlier in
that case this prototype would not be needed ,COMMA  but since I decided that I will be writing it
later .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I decided to just introduce them as prototypes here .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  you should be very
careful about the syntax of the ,COMMA  of writing the prototypes it should have the function type
just like a function name and the parameters .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  you will see later that it is also possible that I could have written something like int
n c r ,COMMA  int comma int that will also mean that this n c r takes two integers as I mean arguments ,COMMA  that will also that is also allowed ,COMMA  but it is nice to write this in
this way .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  next will move to a very important concept ;SEMICOLON  let us quickly have a look at this the
prototype declaration and the function definitions are actually here .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  we are moving to a very important concept of passing the parameters ,COMMA  how do we
pass the parameters from the calling function to the called function .PERIOD  There are two
distinct ways in which it can be done one is calling by value another is calling by
reference .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  right now ,COMMA  let us think of calling by value all right .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  let us try to
understand it in a simple way .PERIOD 

Say ,COMMA  here is my main function or the calling function let me not call it main function as
we have seen they can be nested functions .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is the calling function .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  inside
the calling function I have got some variable x and which may have the value says
somewhere 5 it is an integer .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  somewhere here I am calling a function let us call a
simple function decrement or no decrement add 2 or say add 2 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  whatever is a
value we will add 2 to that simple thing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here I say y is add 2 x and then semicolon
and I go on .PERIOD  And here is my function add 2 int a all right and add 2 is also type integer .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  so a we know is a local variable to the function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here I will take .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will
happen ?QUESTIONMARK  Suppose it was 5 ,COMMA  this will result in a will get 5 and here may be here I declare
another variable say b although it was not necessary ,COMMA  but I am just saying b is a plus 2
because its task is to add 2 and then I say return b .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this b which is an integer is being
returned .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  b which will be in this case it was 5 it will be going back here .PERIOD  I hope this is
clear .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  when you know the scope of variables that b is a variable or a or b whatever the
life of those or the validity of those are restricted only during the life of this function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
but ;SEMICOLON  however ,COMMA  in the case of a looking from the point of view of compiler I have got a
variable a and I have got another variable b and here I have another variable x .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  this
variable x was having the value 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here in x I had 5 by this statement ,COMMA  this statement
made it 5 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  since x is 5 and this one is expecting the value a ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  this 5 will be

copied in a ;SEMICOLON  what is being copied ?QUESTIONMARK  Not x ,COMMA  but the value of x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this one will be will be
getting 5 right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the copy value is being copied ,COMMA  the value is copied in this variable 5 .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  it takes b was something ,COMMA  but here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  b becomes 5 plus 2 b becomes 7 ,COMMA  7 comes
out .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  suppose I change this program a little bit .PERIOD  I erase this b and make it sorry I make it
a .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this b is no longer there this is not required all right this variable has not been
defined I say that this line is also not there ,COMMA  int a and I just do a plus ,COMMA  a assigned a plus 2 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  when it was called add x then from here from here this x was copied here and a
will be incremented to 7 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this will be incremented to 7 and obviously ,COMMA  this will be
return a not return b because b is not there anymore ,COMMA  so 7 ,COMMA  that 7 will be returned here .PERIOD 
But you see if here now ,COMMA  7 has been returned and 7 will be y .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  suppose if I say I am
not following the syntax I am just saying because there is no space here printf something
x .PERIOD  What would be printed ?QUESTIONMARK  For x what would be printed ?QUESTIONMARK  5 will be printed because x is
still 5 x has not changed .PERIOD  I have simply copied the value to the argument variable and
have played with that changed it whatever I wanted to do I have done .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  take a little time to understand this .PERIOD  This means that the variable that I have in the
calling function the value of that will be copied to the argument of the called function .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  there are several advantage is to this one is ,COMMA  so it passes the value of the argument
execution of the function does not change the actual parameter like the actual parameter
was x which was 5 ,COMMA  it remains as 5 although the function added two to that and it came
back all changes to a parameter done inside the function are done on a copy of the actual
parameter not the original parameter .PERIOD  The copy is removed when the function returns to
the caller that entire variable location that was given for the variable a in our example is
returned back to the pool of memory locations .PERIOD  The value of the actual parameters in the
caller is not affected .PERIOD  Consequently it also saves us from some accidental changes
programming that can come copying due to programming errors .PERIOD 

On the other hand the other thing that is another type of parameter passing is known as
call by reference ,COMMA  call by reference .PERIOD  Here we are not copying we are not copying the
variable ,COMMA  we are passing the address of the original argument .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  let us take the earlier example again if I had my main function here and I had
similarly int x and here y was add 2 x here printf something x ,COMMA  and here I had that
function add two int a and here in the body I did a assign a plus 2 and return a ,COMMA  return a .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  here is a variable x and that has got an address say that address is whatever 5000 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  its value here somewhere x was 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  its value is 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here what I am in the
case of reference I am not copying the value of 5 to a instead in the parameter passing I
will write it in a different way not in this way which I will discuss later .PERIOD 
If I assume that this one a ,COMMA  a is not taking the value ,COMMA  but the address of the parameter ,COMMA 
address of the parameter .PERIOD  Means what ?QUESTIONMARK  Means that this time this a here I am passing not
the value 5 ,COMMA  but I am just simply saying that whatever data you want to work with that is
the data is in this location 5000 .PERIOD  And it excepts that reference that the data that I am
working on my a is actually staying 5000 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what it does ?QUESTIONMARK  It takes the when it computes
a assigned a plus 2 this is not looking nice .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let me write it a ,COMMA  a assigned a plus 2 it .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  knows that it is not the value a is here I have to get the value from this location .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
it gets the value from this location ,COMMA  but no other variable location has been allocated
because I know where there is only one common place ,COMMA  only one common place you
have done given something here and you haves told me where you have kept the data
and I am also working in that vessel itself .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  what is happening here is this 5 will be changed to 7 ,COMMA  here only and return I need not
return a it was just return would be sufficient .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  changes have been done here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in
this case when I come to this printf x what will happen what will be printed 7 will be
printed because the actual data has changed here .PERIOD  Let me show it you another example .PERIOD 

Here is my calling function and I think this vessel analogy will be fine .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  it says that
here is the data where I have poured it only tells you where it has poured ,COMMA  the name of the
vessel ,COMMA  suppose the name of the vessel is a there are many other vessels A B C and only
this vessel name has been passed and when this one is doing something it knows the
vessel name A .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it comes here and takes the data from here does something and
returns the data from here and here this program when it is computing when it returns
and then ultimately it returns there and while it returns it takes this value this value the
change value and continues .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in the case of calling by reference we are not copying
the value .PERIOD  On the other hand what would have happen in the case of call by value using
the same vessel analogy ?QUESTIONMARK 

Say ,COMMA  this program was running the value was in a vessel the value was there in a vessel ,COMMA 
but sorry ,COMMA  but my function do not bother about the inter change of colours ;SEMICOLON  my function
was also having its own vessel and when the function has been called the main function
calls this a calls or say x calls y right ,COMMA  then also x copies y ,COMMA  copies the value of the
variable suppose that was a that is copied in the vessel that is belonging to the function it
may be b .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this one does whatever it does here and returns this value over here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
this one is not disturbed whatever changes are being done are ,COMMA  done here .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that is a very fundamental concept in parameter passing .PERIOD  There are two types of
parameter passing one is call by value another is call by reference .PERIOD  Now so ,COMMA  here you see

execution of the function may affect the original because I am sharing the same vessel .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  this in C ,COMMA  in C we actually we are in C we actually carry out only call by value ,COMMA 
only call by value except for the case of arrays except for the case of arrays there is a
reason for that you will understand and for arrays we are not passing the values we are
passing by reference otherwise its always call by value .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  let us have a look at some of the examples here ,COMMA  first example .PERIOD 

We have got the main let us see what is happening ,COMMA  a has been initialised to 10 and b is
not initialised ,COMMA  printf initially a ,COMMA  a .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will be printed ?QUESTIONMARK  Look at this ,COMMA  this will print
first line initially a equals the value of a which is 10 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here ,COMMA  here there is a variable a
which has got the value 10 .PERIOD  Then b is being assigned change a what is change a change a
is a function .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  one mistake is here I should have declared this change prototype here ;SEMICOLON  however ,COMMA  I
should have the function prototype should have been defined earlier .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  I come here
printf before in the ;SEMICOLON  what does the function do prints before x x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  before ,COMMA  so this point
before x equal to x whatever x was ,COMMA  it has got the copy of that x ,COMMA  it has got the copy of
that x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this it was a ,COMMA  a and that has been copied here for its own x ,COMMA  x is also 10 copied
because when it called you actually copied this .PERIOD  When this call was made ,COMMA  when this call
was made first then before that ,COMMA  before that it was also copied here and then only this was
done .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it was printed then x divided by 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x becomes 5 by this statement done .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what is being printed ?QUESTIONMARK  After here this line is being printed here after x equals x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
what will be printed ?QUESTIONMARK  I am still inside the function please remember I am still inside the
function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  5 will be printed and then I return return x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is being returned ?QUESTIONMARK  5 is
being returned where it is being returned here ,COMMA  x has been a has been changed and that is
going to b printf a assigned .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this printf is this printf a sorry a equals here it I am
printing a ,COMMA  a is a ,COMMA  so a is not changed .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is being printed as 10 and b is being printed
as 5 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  you see a has not been changed the reflection of the change has been reflected in this
function and is being assigned to b ,COMMA  clear .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  let us take another example and you will
yourself try to look at this example and a little change has been done let us all together
try to follow this example .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a starting again a mistake is I should have declared the
function prototype here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  those things I have not shown here so ,COMMA  but you should do it .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  let us see here .PERIOD  Again int x equals 10 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x is a variable to the main function x is
having 10 printf M here main function ,COMMA  printing initially x is 10 ,COMMA  there is calling the
function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here the function is being called .PERIOD  And whenever this function is being
called there is a local to the function there is an argument x where this 10 is being
copied .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  printf here ,COMMA  this printf in the function it prints before x was x before changing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
x was x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will be printed ?QUESTIONMARK  10 will be printed .PERIOD  Then I change x here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  at this

point x is becoming 5 ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD  Then I am saying print after the change this is this
printout after that change x is what it has been changed 5 and then I return to the main
function with the change value of x ,COMMA  so b gets 5 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  I am printing in the main function
x is 10 and b is 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it has been changed that is being reflected in this printf and b is
also 5 b was here ,COMMA  b is in the main function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that b has been assigned after this change
and that is also 5 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  the distinction I think will be clear .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  so these are the two cases
that we have shown .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  here let us see this is another example .PERIOD 

Here the slight change that has been done is that the change value I am keeping in x .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  this was x ,COMMA  and x was 10 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  note x was 10 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  initially x is 10 fine ,COMMA  from this
line .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  I have called change x ,COMMA  so it is coming here .PERIOD  But its parameter is also x ,COMMA  but
that really does not matter .PERIOD  These x from here I will create another x .PERIOD  This who is the
owner of this x ,COMMA  the owner of this x is only this function as long as this function is
running these x has got a meaning it is existing other after that it is not there .PERIOD  But since I
called it the value 10 was copied in this ,COMMA  but you see these two are two different memory
locations .PERIOD  Consequently what is happening ?QUESTIONMARK  When I print it here before x was 10 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA 
see which x is being printed ?QUESTIONMARK  This x is being printed because this x is not known to this
function this function only knows its own x then x is changed to 5 that is also done to be
done locally here and is being said here after that the x is 5 because this x is known then
I return x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  5 is returned and 5 is assigned to x .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  whenever I have gone out of this function this x is no longer existing vanishes ;SEMICOLON  that
means ,COMMA  the compiler returns it to the memory pool now .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  which x ?QUESTIONMARK  Is this x ?QUESTIONMARK  This x .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this value that is 5 that is being changed will come here .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  here I am doing printf
x x ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  both b is ,COMMA  so x will be printed as 5 and b equals x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x is also 5 .PERIOD  Here
you see that the same value is the variable is x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  both will be 5 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I hope you could understand this difference .PERIOD  Let us take the another example or we
will come back to this in the next class and we will start with a new example and

continue with parameter passing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what we learnt in todays lecture is a very
important concept of call by value and call by reference and we could see that in C in
general call by value is adopted except for arrays and what is call by value call by value
means the calling function copies the value of the parameter to the variable
corresponding to the argument .PERIOD  Whatever change is done is done locally inside that
argument and when is returned it goes back to the main function ,COMMA  the value goes back to
the main function .PERIOD  Whereas ,COMMA  in case of call by reference the there is only one vessel one
variable and I am not creating another variable ,COMMA  I am simply passing the address of that
variable to the called function and the called function changes in that particular variable
and whatever changes are happening they are reflected in the main function ,COMMA  calling
function as well .PERIOD 
We will continue with this .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we had looked at parameter passing and we have looked ,COMMA  we have seen that the
difference between call by value and call by difference and we have see quite a few
examples to be specific 3 examples on call by value how .PERIOD  And also another thing that
was supposed to be noted I hope you have noted that ,COMMA  that is the scope of variables .PERIOD  That
whenever there is an x in the main function and the x in the called function then these
two xs are different .PERIOD  The x that is defined in the called function is a separate location
than the x in the main function and that the life of that variable ends with the end of the
function ,COMMA  right .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  let us look at these example ,COMMA  you yourself will be able to trace this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I give you
some time to trace this through and then we will continue .PERIOD  Look at this function carefully
and do not look at this green part ,COMMA  do not look at the green part yourself and try to
without looking at that try to find out what the values will be for the different printf
statements .PERIOD 

Let us start .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we have got x assigned to 10 and y assigned to 5 ,COMMA  x and y ,COMMA  x is 10 and y
is 5 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  so when the I printf do this printf x is printed to be 10 y is printed to be 5 fine ,COMMA 
no issue .PERIOD  Then I call a function interchange x y .PERIOD  Look at this the type of this function
interchange the type of this function interchange is void because that immediately tells us
that it is not going to return anything it is going to do something as the name implies it is
going to interchange x and y .PERIOD  And what are the parameters ?QUESTIONMARK  Parameters are x and y this
is the argument .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here I have got another set of x and y .PERIOD 
Again note that this x and y are different .PERIOD  Now I initialize temp ,COMMA  so temp is another
variable here temp .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  what I am doing here ?QUESTIONMARK  The first printf what is being done here
printf x equal to x and y equal to y which x and which y the x this x and this y .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA 
when I entered this function these values have been copied here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the printf will
simply print 10 and 5 no issue now temp is getting x ,COMMA  x was 10 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I put 10 here and
then x assigned y sorry y assigned x ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  the value of y I am still within the
function I am within the function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this value is being assigned .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  by this statement
what happens this becomes 5 and this remains 5 right and then what is being done here y
assign temp ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  this temp is becoming 5 right temp is becoming sorry ,COMMA  sorry I
am sorry absolutely sorry this was 10 .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  for this statement temp is going to y ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  y will be changed to 10 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here
I find 5 and 10 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is a when it entered here I could see 10 and 5 and so when I come
and print from here x will be 5 and y will be 10 ,COMMA  I come out of the program and printf x
and y .PERIOD  What will be printed ?QUESTIONMARK  My god ,COMMA  what I find is x is being printed as 10 and y is
being printed as 5 as it was here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  no change has actually taken place .PERIOD  Why did it
happen like this ?QUESTIONMARK  You can immediately see the reason that whatever change took place
took place here inside the function and this actually tells you the importance of the scope
of variables .PERIOD  These variables scope ended with this function and their change was not
reflected in the main here that is why although I did it here it would not change .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA  suppose let us do some intellectual exercise here .PERIOD 

Suppose x was 10 and y was 5 and there was a temp ,COMMA  now temp is inside the function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
I will use different colours for that I will ,COMMA  now although I remind you that C does not
allow call by reference ,COMMA  but just to see whether you have understood call by reference
properly .PERIOD  Suppose we are allowed to use call by reference then my main program has got
this x and y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it comes here prints say prints x and y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  10 and 5 are printed x equal
to 10 y is equal to 5 and it calls interchange all right ,COMMA  it calls interchange .PERIOD 
And suppose just suppose that this call has been done by call by reference .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what has
been passed here ?QUESTIONMARK  The address of this and the address of this not the values ,COMMA  so no other
copies have been made .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  I have got the local variable temp and here I do temp is
assigned x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  temp gets 10 then x assigned y .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  what is my x and what is my y ?QUESTIONMARK 
The content of this address which have been passed will go to the content of x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this
will be 5 and then y will be assigned temp .PERIOD  What will happen ?QUESTIONMARK  .PERIOD 
This temp this value will go to the suppose I can make call by reference then this will go
to this address ,COMMA  but if I just simply write in this way that does not mean it really does not
tell me whether I am saying that I am copying the from the address of actually copying
the value ,COMMA  but I am just taking telling a hypothetical case .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this 10 will go there and
this 5 would be changed .PERIOD  In that case when I come back from here and I print here then I
would have got the change scenario reflected ,COMMA  but the mechanism writing simply like this

in C means it is called by value not called by reference .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is being passed is
actually the value .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  if I could ,COMMA  if I could do that then it was possible to have that interchange and there is
a mechanism for passing the addresses and not the actual values by using a concept
called I mean structure called pointers which are nothing ,COMMA  but addresses we will have to
we will see that later if time permits .PERIOD  But in general remember that this interchange has
not been possible by call by value in the way we wrote the program .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  with this we
complete our discussion on parameter passing normally ,COMMA  but a distinction between
parameter passing by call by value and call by reference .PERIOD 

And we now start another very important point that is passing arrays to functions .PERIOD 

Now let us try to think .PERIOD  Here when we were having a variable x another variable y in the
called function ,COMMA  in the caller function and I was having in my called function two other
variables a and b ,COMMA  then the value of this would be copied here and the value of this was
copied here .PERIOD  But suppose x is not an integer x is an array of 20 elements then all those 20
elements have to copy here and suppose this is an array of another 20 elements ,COMMA  so
another 20 elements I have to copy here right .PERIOD  C allows only for arrays the parameter
passing by difference .PERIOD  Now in order to understand that let us try to look at the structure
of an array .PERIOD 

Suppose I have got an array a 10 now I am not making a distinction between the size of
the array actual size of the array and the dimension of the array I am assuming that the
array a has got 10 elements .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 all right and these are a 0
a 1 a 2 up to a 9 ,COMMA  right these are the locations we know that .PERIOD  We also know that an array
is allocated contiguous memory locations by the compiler .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  all these are contiguous therefore ,COMMA  it is sufficient to know the address of the starting
location ,COMMA  suppose this is 1000 .PERIOD  If this is 1000 and if it be an integer and I assume that an
integer ,COMMA  integer takes 2 bytes say 16 bits and then this will be 1002 this will be 1004
etcetera I can compute any particular address ,COMMA  any particular address of this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I say a
5 the address of this a 5 address of a 5 can be easily computed as the starting address
thousand whatever is a starting address plus the index is 5 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  and the size of
integer which I know in a particular machine say 2 bytes times how much will be 106 ,COMMA 
108 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will be 2 into whatever is a index minus 1 ;SEMICOLON  sorry a 5 ,COMMA  a 5 will be the 6th
element right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  5 times whatever this is suppose this i ,COMMA  i times i right size of the integer
times i .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  it will be 1000 plus 2 times 5 ,COMMA  1010 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is a 0 a 2 a 0 will be 1006 ,COMMA  a 4 will be
1008 and a 5 will be 1010 .PERIOD  Since it is contiguous it is sufficient for me to know the
starting address of the array ,COMMA  therefore ,COMMA  it is good enough to establish the correspondence
between the name of the array and the starting point of the array .PERIOD  What I mean by that is
again I draw this .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  I named the array differently A and suppose it has got 5 elements all right .PERIOD  Now A
and A 0 are treated to be synonymous .PERIOD  When I say a ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I am actually referring
to this element ,COMMA  this address ,COMMA  not this element this address .PERIOD  And since I know that
therefore ,COMMA  A i depending on the value of i ,COMMA  I can compute where the actual location will
be this is the fundamental concept we need to understand ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  we can
pass the an array to a function as ordinary arguments .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA  is factor whether x i is a factor of x 0 ,COMMA  suppose I want to do that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you
see is factor earlier I did x or y here I am writing x i ,COMMA  x 0 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x i is what ?QUESTIONMARK  Suppose x is an
integer array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x i is an integer x 0 is another integer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can simply pass this ,COMMA  sin of
a particular angle .PERIOD  Where is that angle ?QUESTIONMARK  In an array x an array x is there and in that the
fifth ,COMMA  sixth element I am taking .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this element is coming as the parameter .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us
proceed a little further .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  that is for the individual elements x i or x 5 x 0 I am just passing an element and if
it is an integer array then an integer is being passed if it is a floating array ,COMMA  floating point
array then a float will be passed ,COMMA  but what if I want to pass the entire array to a function .PERIOD 
That is what I just now explained .PERIOD  That is an array name like A can be used as an
argument to a function because A essentially means A 0 and if I can pass A 0 the address
of A 0 is known then all the elements are known because they are contiguous .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  the way it is passed differs from that of the ordinary variables .PERIOD  Why ?QUESTIONMARK  Here when I
have got an array and array A with A 0 when I am passing the array suppose somewhere
in my function f I am passing the array A and just to say that it is an area I just do
something like this .PERIOD  This is not the correct syntax ,COMMA  I will show you the syntax a little
later .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  you see I write it in this way all right .PERIOD  Now that means ,COMMA  I am passing A 0 ,COMMA  but if I
pass the value of A 0 which might be a 50 I have got no clue about the other values I am
not passing all the values .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what do I have to pass ?QUESTIONMARK  if I pass the address of A 0 address
of A 0 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is what is being passed is address of A 0 then I can get access to all these
elements A i ,COMMA  A 1 ,COMMA  A 2 anything because I can compute the address very easily as I have
shown just now ,COMMA  all right ,COMMA  I can do that .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this is an example this is a case where we call by reference we actually will pass the
address and not the value of A 0 .PERIOD  We are passing the address of A 0 and the address of A
0 is the same as the name A this is a very fundamental concept and let us try to
understand this .PERIOD  How is it passed ?QUESTIONMARK  The array name must appear by itself .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  we are
talking about the some syntaxes ,COMMA  the array name must appear by itself as argument
without brackets or subscripts the corresponding formal argument is written in the same
manner .PERIOD  Let us look at an example .PERIOD 

Say here ,COMMA  I am going to pass the whole array as a parameter .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have declared constant
int a size 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  something some variable a size is assigned 5 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  float average is a
function which will which is taking as parameter ,COMMA  sorry which is taking as parameter an
array B all right ,COMMA  just the name of the B only array name or address of B is passed .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA 
this symbol is mentioned to indicate that this is an array right .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  let us see what is
happening int i total 0 ,COMMA  for i equals 0 i less than a size ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  less than 5 i plus plus
total equals total plus b i .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is happening ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  here is an array B ,COMMA  here is an array
A ,COMMA  a size the array size is 5 and all these elements are being added .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  all these elements are being added in this loop .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  B i only B 1 ,COMMA  B 2 ,COMMA  B 0 ,COMMA  B 1 ,COMMA  B 2 ,COMMA 
B 0 ,COMMA  B 4 they are being added to total and then I am returning what am I returning I am
returning total divided by a size now there is a new thing here also its better to look into
that .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  the array now average will be a floating point number and B is an integer
array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  sometimes ,COMMA  when i ,COMMA  so what has been done here is float a size when we do this
float some variable x ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  this variable is being type casted is being made to be
represented as a float .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if it was 5 ,COMMA  5 suppose then float A size .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  since is 5 float A
size will make it 5 .PERIOD 0 .PERIOD 
And suppose the array was 1 2 0 4 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  9 to 11 ,COMMA  12 total was 12 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  float total will
make it 12 .PERIOD 0 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am casting twelve forcing it to be represented as a float .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  then 12 .PERIOD 0
is being divided by 5 with 5 .PERIOD 0 and I am getting the average and that average is being

returned here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is that was not our main contention here that is the purpose of this
float .PERIOD  But the main contention here is that I have passed this array B ,COMMA  but who passed it
the main function .PERIOD  Let us study the main function .PERIOD 
The main function x is an array of size A size that is 5 and x average is of some variable
and x has been assigned as 10 20 30 40 50 ;SEMICOLON  x average I will compute ,COMMA  but I am calling
this function average from here and I am passing x .PERIOD  What is x ?QUESTIONMARK  x is an array and that is
appearing just as a variable here and that is being accepted as B .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is a
correspondence between x and B ,COMMA  x is somewhere suppose starting with location 5000
and there are 5 elements as I been said here 10 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  30 ,COMMA  40 ,COMMA  50 .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  when this x is passed to B this function now knows that B is an array because it
had this thing and this 5000 is passed to B .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  B knows where is B ,COMMA  B is the same
array .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  whatever change I do here ,COMMA  suppose in this function instead of computing the
total if I had written this function in a different way for example let us do that and
suppose I have got this function x ,COMMA  I have got this function x this array ,COMMA  sorry I am sorry x
where 10 20 30 40 50 are there and in my function change ,COMMA  I can also say void change int
B this and in the body of the function what I do is for please try to understand i assign 0
to this ,COMMA  i less than equal to A size or 5 whatever it is ,COMMA  i plus plus ,COMMA  B i plus plus say this .PERIOD 
What will happen ?QUESTIONMARK 

Inside this function change I will take the first one change it to 11 ,COMMA  this one will be 21 ,COMMA 
this one will be 31 ,COMMA  this only 41 ,COMMA  this only 51 and when I return I made a change in B ,COMMA  but
B and x are the same because this address 5000 was passed to the function change and
this b got 5000 and so whatever change has been done here will be reflected in the main
function when I return ,COMMA  clear .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that is the importance .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here I have called it with the actual array name here of
course ,COMMA  I computed a total and return some other value ,COMMA  but if I had just change it inside
this function I could have made it void function and the change would have been
automatically reflected in the name .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here you see we do not need to write the array size it works with arrays of any size .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA  here void this etcetera where list is an array of 100 elements and average I
am calling here float average int a is an integer ,COMMA  and float x is map to list all right ,COMMA  x is an
array because here how is the correspondence done .PERIOD  This list ,COMMA  list is being mapped to this
same address is being passed and n is being passed to a how many elements are there ,COMMA  all
right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I need not specify the size because the size is already specified here .PERIOD  I have got
100 element array ,COMMA  this is my list ,COMMA  this is list right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have got 100 element here I
know .PERIOD  What I have passed to x is just the address .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  whatever it is 100 or 150 that be
true for x also right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we do not need to write the size of the array .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  similarly array is used as output parameters .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  suppose I am going to do vector
sum ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I have got two arrays a and b .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what I am doing here ?QUESTIONMARK  I have got two
arrays a ,COMMA  an integer array another integer array b and I am adding them .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will add this
element say 5 with this 7 and I have got another array v sum ,COMMA  v sum where the sum will
be stored so this will be 12 ,COMMA  if it was 6 and this was 5 here we will store I will add these
two and I will store 11 ok .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  let us see how the vector sum .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  vector sum will be void you know because it is
doing the addition and the addition is remaining in this vector sum .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have got let us
start with the main function x is an array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is actually x a or let me say let me put
the main function first .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will be x in the main function and a in the this function y
slash b .PERIOD  I am writing slash b because these two was the same because the address is
shared all right and vector sum will be z .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  z or vector sum .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x is 1 2 3 ,COMMA  y is 4 5 6
and z ,COMMA  z has not been initialized because ,COMMA  so let me let me ;SEMICOLON  so that you are not confused ,COMMA 
let me do it like this .PERIOD 

I have got an array that is x having values 1 2 3 ,COMMA  another array y having values 4 5 6 and
another array ,COMMA  another array z which will have the final value and z all right it is 0
elements ,COMMA  but we do not know the value .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  I am calling vector sum and what am I
passing x is being passed to this x goes to this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is known as a for the function y
goes to this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is known as b .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x and a locations are shared z and v sum the
locations are shared ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  I am calling vector sum .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  all these are being added in a loop 5 7 9 ,COMMA  then I come
out I come out .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  you see when I come out of this function these are already reflected
because it was passed by reference .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  let us look at the print ,COMMA  print vector what is
happening here .PERIOD  Void print vector that is another function that I am calling here z 3 ;SEMICOLON  that
means ,COMMA  3 elements will be printed from that z array z array was here which had that
elements like 5 ,COMMA  7 and 9 .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  with that print vector it is just in a loop i equal to 0 ,COMMA  i less than length .PERIOD  What is
length ?QUESTIONMARK  Length is 3 and what is the array z is a .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  this a and this a are different again ,COMMA 
this a and this a are different .PERIOD  This a ,COMMA  this is this a was this functions a and this a is this
function a .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  they are different .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here they are printing 5 ,COMMA  7 ,COMMA  9 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is as an
output parameter .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  you see actually whenever I am reflecting on an array I need not pass it because
essentially automatically passed right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is what is very important .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I hope you
have understood this .PERIOD 

The actual mechanism is when an array is passed it is the array elements are not passed ,COMMA 
but what is passed is an address and the argument becomes a pointer to the first element
or a pointer to the first element ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  the address of the first element .PERIOD  And when
an array element is accessed inside the function the address is calculated I have already
explained the formula that is used for finding the array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is known as call by
reference .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I think you have understood this .PERIOD  We will continue our discussions in the future
lectures on some other important issues .PERIOD 

We have discussed about passing arrays as parameters .PERIOD  And for passing arrays as
parameters in C to ,COMMA  C functions we take the course to call by reference .PERIOD  Otherwise for all
other parameter passing we take the course to call by value .PERIOD  And just to summarize the
call by value and call by reference .PERIOD  Call by value we copy the value of the actual
parameter to the formal parameter ;SEMICOLON  formal argument and in call by reference we do not
copy the value ,COMMA  but we just pass on the address of the pointer and reference to the actual
parameter ok .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  as a result ;SEMICOLON  what happens ?QUESTIONMARK  That if any change to that variable is resulted in the
function itself ,COMMA  in the case of call by value that will not be automatically reflected to the
main program ,COMMA  but in the case of call by reference since there is no other separate copy
that will automatically be reflected .PERIOD  Just to conclude that part we will see a number of
applications of functions just to come to conclude that .PERIOD 

Let us have a quick look at 1 function ,COMMA  but there is no idea ,COMMA  but just vision of the
prototypes that you can see here ,COMMA  finding the maximum of 3 integers .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we have the header file ,COMMA  here include studio dot h .PERIOD  Then here we declared a function
prototype .PERIOD  The actual function maximum has been written later .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here you see that
what does this line tell us ?QUESTIONMARK  This line tells us that maximum is a function and it consists of
3 integer arguments ,COMMA  or 3 integer parameters will come .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  as if this is a function which
has got 3 input doors and each door is wide enough to accommodate an integer ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
that much is told .PERIOD  And whatever is inside this I am not aware of that ,COMMA  and at this stage I
am not aware of that .PERIOD  And the output will also be another integer that is told by this .PERIOD 
Then so ,COMMA  here the salient point to see is that here I have just it was sufficient to just
specify the types ,COMMA  no names have been put in .PERIOD  Now comes the main program that is very
simple a ,COMMA  b ,COMMA  c are 3 integers .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  they are local to this function ,COMMA  enter the integers abc are interred here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you know ;SEMICOLON 
what a is ?QUESTIONMARK  what b is ,COMMA  and what c is ,COMMA  and then you are calling inside c .PERIOD  Here inside the print
f I can call maximum with the parameters a ,COMMA  b ,COMMA  c and we come here .PERIOD  And here I have
defined here I did not name here I did not name the variables ;SEMICOLON  here I have defined the
names of the variables int x ,COMMA  int y ,COMMA  int z .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this x ,COMMA  y ,COMMA  z again property of this maximum
alright .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  xyz are here .PERIOD  And the algorithm of the logic is simple .PERIOD  Initially I make max to be x ;SEMICOLON  if
y is greater than max and y is the max ,COMMA  otherwise z is the max and then I am returning
max .PERIOD  I am returning max means I am coming here ,COMMA  and then that max is being printed .PERIOD 

And returns 0 now my main function ,COMMA  where is my main ?QUESTIONMARK  Main is here ,COMMA  main has got a
type int .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am returning 0 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  int will if at the end of ,COMMA  the main function a 0 is
returned ,COMMA  I will assume that the program has successfully completed ok .PERIOD  The reason I
brought up this example is just to illustrate this case that you need not at the prototype
level you can escape specifying the parameters .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is a prototype declaration ,COMMA  function calling ,COMMA  and function definition you know
that .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this are already repeated I am not going into that .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  instead I will be talking about a new thing here ,COMMA  that is hash include .PERIOD 

We have talked about hash include ,COMMA  we have used hash include .PERIOD  And we menti1d that
hash include is nothing but a preprocessor statement .PERIOD  A preprocessor statement how ?QUESTIONMARK  Say
hash includes filename .PERIOD  We have seen hash include studio dot h ,COMMA  but it can be for that
matter any file name ,COMMA  hash include file name .PERIOD 
Say for example I can specify the full path ,COMMA  say slash usr in a Linux environment slash
home rajan my file dot h .PERIOD  I want to include this file ;SEMICOLON  I want to include this file in mind for
serving .PERIOD  This file in my program ,COMMA  all right ;SEMICOLON  the content of the corresponding file will be
included in the present file ,COMMA  before compilation is d1 before compilation is d1 .PERIOD  And the
compiler will compile there after considering the content as it is .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is a preprocessor
statement .PERIOD  That is ,COMMA  I put that inside that hash include that file is included and then the
compilation is d1 ok .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  let us look at this hash include example .PERIOD  Look at this program segment which is
my source program ,COMMA  which is known as proc dot c .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is my source program .PERIOD  This
source program has got hash include no stdio dot h ,COMMA  but it has just said that in hash
include my file dot h ,COMMA  and then a main program follows ok .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  this my file dot h is
nothing but another file ,COMMA  which is which has got hash include stdio dot h and index .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  when I include my file dot h ,COMMA  then this particular file will be included this particular
file that is this segment will be included here .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  consequently what will happen is when I say in general hash include file name dot h
it includes a file name file ,COMMA  file name dot h from a specific directory which is known as
the include directory .PERIOD  When I say hash include it takes from the include directory ,COMMA  and in
the include directory I have kept my file dot h ,COMMA  and consequently when that is included
the ultimately the thing that looks like is ,COMMA  it will be it will look like this .PERIOD 
Because that hash include I am sorry ,COMMA  there should not be an inverted comma here ,COMMA  it
should be just hash include stdio dot h followed by intex .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this whole thing whole
thing has been has replaced my file dot h .PERIOD  And where was my file dot h ?QUESTIONMARK  My file dot h
was under user usr include file name dot h .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is how the include I can have other
files included in my program .PERIOD  Now another point of critical discussion a is macro
definition .PERIOD  We have seen the macros like hash define .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  let us so ,COMMA  that is again a preprocessor directive .PERIOD  We have seen that hash include is a
preprocessor command ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  even before the compilation is d1 ;SEMICOLON  that is ,COMMA  that is
copied there on the other hand ,COMMA  you see the preprocessor directive of hash defined string
1 string 2 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  string 1 should be replaced by string 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  how does it happen ?QUESTIONMARK  It
replaces string 1 by string to whenever it occurs ,COMMA  where ever it occurs ,COMMA  where ever it
occurs before compilation .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  for example ,COMMA  hash defined pi to be 3 .PERIOD 14 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  wherever it will find this pi ,COMMA  wherever it
will find this pi ,COMMA  it will replace that with 3 .PERIOD 14 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here for example ,COMMA  you see ,COMMA  we have got hash include stdio dot h ,COMMA  then we define pi to
be 3 .PERIOD 14 as the hash define preprocessor command .PERIOD  Now in my main program I have got
float r 4-time 4 ;SEMICOLON  r is 4 ,COMMA  and area is another variable both are float .PERIOD  Now area is pi times r
times r ,COMMA  r is already initialized .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will happen is this will be translated to this pi
will be replaced .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the body will be float r assigned 4 and area .PERIOD 
And area is so ,COMMA  r is 4 ,COMMA  and area will be 3 .PERIOD 14 times r times r .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  before come even before
compilation ,COMMA  this pi is being replaced by 3 of the value 3 .PERIOD 14 as has been stated in the hash
defined command .PERIOD 

We can also give hash define with an argument .PERIOD  Till now we have seen hash define pi as
a constant hash define some constant k to be 5 or whatever .PERIOD  Here we can also define
some functions .PERIOD  Like you see hash define square x is x times x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  wherever square x
will appear ,COMMA  that will be replaced by x times x ok .PERIOD 

Say for example ,COMMA  here let us look at this program again .PERIOD  I think you are not being able to
read this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let me go back say let me have if I have ,COMMA  declared say ,COMMA  hash define square x
is x times x .PERIOD 

Then in my program ,COMMA  wherever I will get say ,COMMA  p is assigned square y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this will be
translated as p assigned y times y ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this ;SEMICOLON  what should be d1 that has already been
told here that square x is this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this will simply replace it ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is the purpose of
hash define here ,COMMA  we can see that and so ,COMMA  let us look at this example again .PERIOD 

Main y is 5 ,COMMA  print f value is y times y ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  this is being repeat this is what has
been generated after the square x has been square here it was square x plus 3 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that has
become y times y plus 3 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  which 1 is faster to execute ?QUESTIONMARK  You can think of I can if I

write square x written as a macro definition ,COMMA  then I am pasting as if I am pasting the body
of the code inside this in the main program replacing that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I do not need to call any
function .PERIOD  I can write it as a macro definition and I as a result even before compilation .PERIOD 
Even before compilation ,COMMA  I can get this look .PERIOD  And so ,COMMA  this can be straightaway applied
without requiring to call a function .PERIOD  Now if square x is written as an ordinary function ,COMMA 
not like a macro definition ,COMMA  in that case I have to call a function ,COMMA  and calling a function
has got some overheads which I am not discussing here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if it be a very simple thing
like this it is better to make it a macro .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that it automatically gets pasted and it
becomes faster .PERIOD 

However ,COMMA  there is a word of caution for example ,COMMA  if I had defined square x ,COMMA  now it is now
when I am defining as a macro it is I have to ensure that it is correct .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  if I
define square x as x times x .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  how the macro definition substitution will be carried
out ?QUESTIONMARK  Let us look at this .PERIOD  If there be something like r assigned square of a plus square of
30 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  it will be a times a plus 30 times 30 .PERIOD  That is how it will happen ok ,COMMA  now what about r
square of a plus b ?QUESTIONMARK  It will be simply pasted as a plus b times a plus b .PERIOD  Consequently ,COMMA  the
result will be wrong ,COMMA  because in the during execution b times a will be d1 first ,COMMA  and then
that will be added with a and with b .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is not what I intended .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  if I had
d1 this ,COMMA  define this as like this ,COMMA  and like this ,COMMA  this problem would not have occurred .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  unless I do that this a plus b should will not be I need to take if I define it like this
then it becomes this which is the correct 1 .PERIOD  But unless I do that it will lead to a wrong
result .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you must be very careful about it ,COMMA  this is wrong .PERIOD  And the macro definition should
have been written as I have shown square x is x times x ,COMMA  in that case we would have got
the correct result .PERIOD  Now before moving to anything else ,COMMA  we will now look at some
applications of what we have learned .PERIOD  We are now at a position where we have learnt all
the fundamental tools ,COMMA  without the sophistications ,COMMA  that are required to write a program
ok .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  suppose I want to solve a problem like this .PERIOD  That ,COMMA  I have got 5 students in the class ;SEMICOLON 
and the 5 students have got 5 names of course ,COMMA  and each of them have got some marks ,COMMA 
total marks ,COMMA  right .PERIOD  Now how do I represent that ?QUESTIONMARK  And I want to find out which student I
want to print the name of the student who has got the highest marks ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK  Is the
problem clear let me repeat the problem ,COMMA  I have got 5 students in a class ?QUESTIONMARK  And I want to
find out which student has got the highest marks .PERIOD  And I want to know the name of that
student ok .PERIOD 
How can I solve this problem ?QUESTIONMARK  This is a simple problem .PERIOD  Here what I will need is ,COMMA  first I
will need an array of the names of the students .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first I need an array of the names of
the students .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here 5 names will be stored very ,COMMA  very disproportionate array .PERIOD  And let me call this
array to be name or names .PERIOD  And on this side ,COMMA  I have got another array ,COMMA  which holds the
marks order of the different students .PERIOD  Corresponding to the roll number maybe 1 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  4 ,COMMA 
5 the marks are stored here .PERIOD  Somebody got 50 ,COMMA  somebody got 55 ,COMMA  somebody got 62 ,COMMA 
somebody 70 ,COMMA  somebody 32 .PERIOD  Say ,COMMA  and their names are a ,COMMA  b ,COMMA  c ,COMMA  l m p q x and y ;SEMICOLON  suppose ,COMMA 
these are names ,COMMA  these are the different names .PERIOD  Now why do I need to add is ,COMMA  these are
this ;SEMICOLON  the array called marks .PERIOD  Why do I need 2 ?QUESTIONMARK  2 arrays ,COMMA  first of all the arrays should be
holding same type of data .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  what is the type of data that the array names are holding ?QUESTIONMARK  It is a array of character or
character string .PERIOD  Now how can I represent these names ?QUESTIONMARK  I can represent them as an array
of an array of strings ,COMMA  or each of these names is what each of these names is a character
array .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  if I just look at names ,COMMA  names will look like a 2-dimensional array .PERIOD  Now
what would be my algorithm first of all come to the representation .PERIOD 
Later ,COMMA  what would my ;SEMICOLON  be my algorithm ?QUESTIONMARK  First of all ,COMMA  I will have to go to this mark array
which is simpler it is an array of integers ,COMMA  assuming all integer marks are given .PERIOD  Then I
will have to carry out find out the maximum of this .PERIOD  And you can write a function to find
the maximum of an array ,COMMA  right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us try to write the function first so ,COMMA  I have got an
array marks ;SEMICOLON  which has got 5 elements ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I can call a function max ,COMMA  what let us first of all think of this maximum value what
will it return me ?QUESTIONMARK  Say ,COMMA  it we will find out say if I come to this ,COMMA  it will find out which 1 is
the maximum ,COMMA  and will return me an index ,COMMA  right or this is not the maximum sorry this 1
is the maximum .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  it will return me an index 0 1 2 3 so ,COMMA  it will return me an integer .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  I can
start with like this that int maximum of I can call an array ,COMMA  integer array int suppose that
is m ,COMMA  this and the main function will call it with marks .PERIOD  And inside this what will happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
You know ,COMMA  initially let me call a value int this is a local max assigned m 0 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I initialize
a variable max with m 0 .PERIOD  Now for I assign some index i .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I have to declare I also here .PERIOD  I assigned 1 i less than equal to 5 less than equal to 4 ,COMMA 
sorry ,COMMA  less than equal to 4 ,COMMA  i plus
 .PERIOD  Here if mi is greater than max ,COMMA  then if I then max is mi .PERIOD  And that will go on .PERIOD  Now
ultimately what shall I turned from this ?QUESTIONMARK  Should I return the max ,COMMA  no ,COMMA  I am returning the
value of i .PERIOD  Because ,COMMA  where I found the maximum now ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  for that now this I is
changing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here I will also have to make say .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let me just make this I to be 0 ,COMMA  let me
make this i to be initially i is 0 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I could have d1 away with this .PERIOD  And wherever I get
this max I am changing this i ,COMMA  whenever I am getting this max I can say that there is
another max index .PERIOD  And I am making max index equals i .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am remembering where I
found the max and I will be returning the max index ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  my maximum function in this way ,COMMA  what it will do is it will sorry it will find out the
maximum so ,COMMA  it will return 3 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the first thing is find max .PERIOD  Now I have got an array
names ,COMMA  how does that represent it ?QUESTIONMARK  The representation can be as strings or it can be as an
array of characters .PERIOD  If I consider this to be an array of characters ,COMMA  then remember that it is
a 2-dimensional array ok .PERIOD  And I will in that case I will take .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this 3 and I will come to
this 3 this ,COMMA  and I will print out this particular element from that array ok .PERIOD  So now ,COMMA  what
about these names let us see .PERIOD  Names is an address a p ,COMMA  q ,COMMA  r or something .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I can have this as an array of characters .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  p q r l m whatever it is ,COMMA  and this part is
blank .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is my declaration of names ?QUESTIONMARK  Names will be there are 5 names ,COMMA  5 rows
and each row is a character .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  it is a character array char names ,COMMA  let me write it here .PERIOD  Char names 5 rows ,COMMA  and each
row may have 3 columns ,COMMA  right .PERIOD  At best like this lm p lm k pq r like that say .PERIOD  Now I have
suppose come with that maximum index was this rows so ,COMMA  that is 3 .PERIOD  Now how do I print
this pq r name here ,COMMA  if it is kept is a string I could have straight with percentage s format .PERIOD 
But here how would I do with this here I can ,COMMA  I will have I will print which row I will
print .PERIOD  I am not writing the entire code ok .PERIOD  Print f which row would I print I had print the
names 3 ,COMMA  but there are 3 characters .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  names 3 in a loop I have to print right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  print f
so ,COMMA  how would the printing be d1 ?QUESTIONMARK  How do I print ?QUESTIONMARK  1 rows of an array a 2 dimensional so ,COMMA 

here I come .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will print in a loop names 3 0 3 1 3 2 ok .PERIOD  Actually ,COMMA  this is 3 should be
somewhere here ,COMMA  it is confusing 3 should be somewhere here say a ,COMMA  b ,COMMA  c .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  3 is actually this row .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  names I will be printing 3 0 3 1 3 2 and that I can print in a
for loop .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I leave it to you to try to print this in the character format .PERIOD  You can also try
it in the string format .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what we have d1 here is ,COMMA  we have seen the how the macros are
replace replaced ,COMMA  and we will see further examples of functions all through in the future
lectures ,COMMA  where we will be applying functions and arrays consequently .PERIOD 

We have seen functions in the earlier lecture .PERIOD  And we have also seen we tried to solve a
problem with where there were names of the students in one array ,COMMA  and the marks in
another array .PERIOD  And we tried to find out try to print out the name of the student who got
the highest marks so ,COMMA  for that we had 2 different arrays .PERIOD  Now the same thing I can do
today say I have 10 students .PERIOD 

And each of them have appeared for ,COMMA  I am so sorry ,COMMA  each of them has appeared for 4
subjects ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD  Or let us say there are 5 students ,COMMA  and each of them has appeared for 4
subjects .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  how do I ,COMMA  what would be a convenient way of representing them ?QUESTIONMARK  One
convenient way of representing them would be to have a 2-dimensional matrix ,COMMA  2-
dimensional array ,COMMA  where on this side I will have the roll number of the students ,COMMA  which
is an integer and I have got 5 students .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  1 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  4 and 5 ,COMMA  5 students ,COMMA  and the marks as
the columns right ,COMMA  for any problem solving we will have to think of how can we
represent the data so that our computation is made easy .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  at our computation is
facilitated .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  suppose there are 5 students say roll number one ,COMMA  roll number 2 ,COMMA  roll number 3 ,COMMA  roll
number 4 ,COMMA  roll number 5 ,COMMA  and for each of them we have got 4 columns for the 4 subjects ,COMMA 
right .PERIOD  Suppose the subjects are say language science ,COMMA  mathematics and say history ,COMMA  4
subjects right .PERIOD  And so ,COMMA  how would I read the marks ?QUESTIONMARK  How would I first of all store the
marks of the students ,COMMA  you can very easily understand now ,COMMA  now I am not writing the
program I am leaving the writing of the program to you .PERIOD 
But let us try to understand how it can possibly be solved .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will have a function ,COMMA  I
can write a function of acquiring data .PERIOD  What will that do ?QUESTIONMARK  For on this side ,COMMA  I can have an
index i ,COMMA  that will talk about the row that I am talking about ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  which student I
am talking about and another index maybe j or instead of i j you can say roll and marks ,COMMA 
that is also fine ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  keeping I fixed ,COMMA  and then you can fill up the row of the marks of
the student .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  how would that program segment look like ?QUESTIONMARK  That program segment will
look like for i assigned 0 ,COMMA  i less than equal to 4 ,COMMA  because there are 5 students ,COMMA  i plus plus .PERIOD 

That is for one row for j equals 0  ,COMMA  j less than equal to 3 ,COMMA  because there are 4 columns j
plus plus  ,COMMA  scanf now you know what to write within the scanf ok .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  in that way I can read the marks .PERIOD  What I was saying is that instead of this I can see
for ,COMMA  I can be very clear about it ,COMMA  for roll equal to 0 roll less than equal to 4 roll plus plus ,COMMA 
sorry  ,COMMA  roll plus plus .PERIOD  And for j similarly I can make marks .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  marks 0 ,COMMA  marks less than
3 ,COMMA  marks plus plus it is a train that way I can fill up the table ok .PERIOD  So now ,COMMA  in that way ,COMMA  I

can fill up the table and say ,COMMA  I get the marks as 50 ,COMMA  25 ,COMMA  70 ,COMMA  35 like that some numbers .PERIOD 
Now I can have another function that will find out the total marks of each student .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
right now I do not have a space for that .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I can keep that in mind when I am preparing my table ,COMMA  then I can have the fifth
column for the total marks ,COMMA  right .PERIOD  Now I will pass on I have read this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first of all ,COMMA  I in
from my main program ,COMMA  I went to a particular function I called a particular function ,COMMA 
which acquired the data and filled up all these .PERIOD  Say ,COMMA  70 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  90 ,COMMA  15 ,COMMA  35 ,COMMA  75 ,COMMA  90 ,COMMA  80 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  25 ,COMMA 
60 ,COMMA  30 ,COMMA  10 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  30 ,COMMA  40 .PERIOD  Like that that it has been prepared .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  quickly let us see what we
did .PERIOD 

We had we entered into a main function .PERIOD  And from the main function ,COMMA  I called invoked a
function ,COMMA  which is acquired data ,COMMA  and what should the type of that function be acquired
data ,COMMA  is it returning anything ?QUESTIONMARK  No .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  it should be something like void acquire data d .PERIOD  And where is it acquiring the data ?QUESTIONMARK 
In the integer array ,COMMA  int say let us call that array A and there should be it is a 2-
dimensional array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I should have something like this .PERIOD  This time writing clearly int a if
that array was a ,COMMA  that was the parameter .PERIOD  Now so ,COMMA  here that was array A ,COMMA  and here it has
been called like acquire data ,COMMA  say ,COMMA  my array .PERIOD  And also the size has been specified .PERIOD  The
size is suppose globally specified .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I get that array size .PERIOD  Suppose it is defined that row roll size is 5 and subject size is 4 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I know ,COMMA  but this says subject size plus 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I needed one more .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can I can go
here and from there ,COMMA  I returned here .PERIOD  And then I can call another fine total of my array .PERIOD 
Then what will you do ?QUESTIONMARK  Essentially ,COMMA  I come to this ,COMMA  and what does that function do that
piece of function ;SEMICOLON  that is ,COMMA  finding out the total of each student .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that will again be a for loop like the one that we had done earlier ,COMMA  and I will add keep
I to be fixed ,COMMA  and add these and write the total here .PERIOD  Now I could have kept it here ,COMMA  or I
can have another array total let us do that ,COMMA  suppose I am not having I am just having the
marks here .PERIOD  And the total array is not here ,COMMA  but a separate array all together ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I have another array which is total .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can have the sum of each of them being
passed to this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in that case when I am calling ,COMMA  when I am calling fine total then I am
passing on this array as well as the total array 2 arrays because I want to put the sum on
the total array ok .PERIOD  With that I can find the sum of this sum of this ,COMMA  sum of this ,COMMA  sum of
this ,COMMA  sum of this .PERIOD  And then I can make another function ,COMMA  where it finds the max or
whatever I want to do .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  accordingly the point is that for each of the activities ,COMMA  I can make small small
functions .PERIOD  One is for acquiring data ;SEMICOLON  one is for finding the total .PERIOD  One is for finding the
maximum number ,COMMA  or maybe some other things also sorting and all those .PERIOD  I can do ,COMMA  I can
find out the failure list another function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can have a complete set of small small
functions .PERIOD 

Each independently done ,COMMA  say did acquiring data ,COMMA  finding total ,COMMA  finding max ,COMMA  all these and
they are communicating through a main program ,COMMA  and the main program my data is one
array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let me let me draw the data using red .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  here I have got my array ,COMMA  which was called my array ,COMMA  array which had the size 5 ,COMMA  5
and 4 .PERIOD  And I had another array total ,COMMA  total which is a one-dimensional array how many ?QUESTIONMARK  5
students so these 2 so ,COMMA  the main function is invoking from different points for different
tasks these functions .PERIOD  And this function is working on this array ,COMMA  shared array .PERIOD  This
function is working on this array and generating the total ,COMMA  maybe this function is doing
something else .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that these arrays are being shared by the main function and the small functions .PERIOD  That
is how using functions I can divide a task into smaller sub tasks and can do it very nicely .PERIOD 
Now with this ,COMMA  now let us move to another problem one a version of which we had
encountered earlier ;SEMICOLON  that is ,COMMA  searching an array .PERIOD  When we have got an array for example ,COMMA 
here when he found say suppose ,COMMA  I found the total here .PERIOD  I found the total ,COMMA  and from there I
find out which one is a maximum or is it that if there is any student whose total is less
than 100 ,COMMA  I want to test that .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I have to search this array .PERIOD  Similarly ,COMMA  I can search if there is any student ,COMMA  who has got
in science more than 90 .PERIOD  I can search that along this array ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK  I find if there is any
40 is the pass mark ,COMMA  if there is any student .PERIOD  Who has not passed in maths ?QUESTIONMARK  I find here

there is a failure case .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  for that I need to do a search .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  search is very fundamental ,COMMA 
search is absolutely fundamental to computation .PERIOD  And so ,COMMA  first we have already seen
linear search ,COMMA  but I once again have a journey through that ok .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we know that in a search we are given a key which we are searching for a particular
key that we want to find out ,COMMA  if the key is present in the array ,COMMA  then we have to say that
the key is present and also the position where the key is present ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD  Now we will
consider 2 cases .PERIOD  One is that the array is unsorted .PERIOD 
What do I mean by unsorted ?QUESTIONMARK  By unsorted I mean that the elements are not in any
particular order .PERIOD 

For example ,COMMA  think of this array where the elements are 5 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  9 ,COMMA  8 ,COMMA  17 ,COMMA  6 .PERIOD  Now this array
is not in any increasing order ,COMMA  not in some decreasing order .PERIOD  It is decreasing here
decreasing here .PERIOD  Again ,COMMA  increased here ,COMMA  decreased here ,COMMA  again increased here ,COMMA  decreased
here .PERIOD  On the other hand ,COMMA  if the array was something like this ;SEMICOLON  say ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  sorry ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA 
5 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  8 ,COMMA  9 ,COMMA  17 .PERIOD  Then this array is sorted in an increasing order .PERIOD  That as I go from top to
down it is in an increasing order ,COMMA  it is sorted in increasing order .PERIOD  It could be sorted ,COMMA  in the
decreasing order also .PERIOD  Like ,COMMA  say for example ,COMMA  I start with 17 ,COMMA  then 9 ,COMMA  then 8 ,COMMA  then 6 ,COMMA  then
5 ,COMMA  then 3 ,COMMA  then 2 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this is as we go down the numbers are decreasing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these are ordered or sorted .PERIOD 
And this is unsorted .PERIOD  These also sorted ,COMMA  but in a different order .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I may have to search
from an array that is either unsorted or sorted .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first let us think of dealing with
unsorted arrays ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD  And we will look into the linear search algorithm for doing
that .PERIOD  And if the elements are sorted we have got a more efficient such algorithm called
the binary search .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  linear search we have already seen in an earlier lecture .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the basic idea is we start
at the beginning of the array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if we come here ,COMMA  if we come here ,COMMA  sorry ,COMMA  we start say I
want to search this .PERIOD  I start at the beginning of the array .PERIOD  I start here .PERIOD  And I have got a key .PERIOD 
A key is there ,COMMA  say key is 8 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I start from the top .PERIOD 
Look for the availability of a look for the element matching the key ,COMMA  5 is not matching 8 ,COMMA 
then I go on increasing this index ,COMMA  and go on comparing till I find either if 8 is not there ,COMMA  I
will come to the end of the array all the elements have been checked I have not found the
match ,COMMA  or when I get the match I will say that at this position ,COMMA  I have got the key
matching ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we will start at the beginning of the adding ,COMMA  and inspect every
element to see if it matches the key .PERIOD  Now if I want to do it in this way ,COMMA  we often talk
about time complexity ,COMMA  it is a measure I am not going into the formal way of the
measure ,COMMA  the measure of how long an algorithm takes to run .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  as you can understand ,COMMA  if there are n elements in the array ,COMMA  then the best case would
be let us you will find out what it will be say ,COMMA  I start with this .PERIOD  It may be supposed ,COMMA  the
key was 5 ,COMMA  suppose the key was 5 .PERIOD  In that case ,COMMA  that is the best case with one match one
comparison I find it how many comparisons how many inspections I needed only one .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that is the best case ,COMMA  the worst case could be if my key was 6 .PERIOD  If my key was 6 ,COMMA  then I
would have to inspect every element .PERIOD  And since there are 7 elements here ,COMMA  I had to carry
out 7 comparisons ,COMMA  7 inspections till I found the match right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the best case would be first element one inspection one search operation .PERIOD  And the
worst case would be no match found .PERIOD  Either the last element or not at all found even after
that .PERIOD  In that case I need n search operations .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the best case is one ,COMMA  the worst case is if
the size of the array is n ,COMMA  then n .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the average would be n plus 1 by 2 search
operations ,COMMA  n plus 1 by 2 that is a cost how much time that gives a measure of the time
the algorithm will take to run .PERIOD 

So now we are trying to write it we had explained this algorithm also earlier .PERIOD  But now
that we have done functions ,COMMA  let us write a function for linear search .PERIOD  Why am I writing
the function ?QUESTIONMARK  Say again if I go to this case .PERIOD  Now I may like to say my task is to find out
whether I any student who has got more than 80 ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will need to write a
function ,COMMA  I have to search this in a linear way in a sequential way one after another and
for that I have to write a function .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  how is that function ,COMMA  how will that function look like ?QUESTIONMARK  Let us see what are the things I
need I have got an array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I need to know which array I will be working with ,COMMA  and that
is this array A .PERIOD  And what is the size of the array n whatever that is 7 maybe in our case
the example that I was showing was 7 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is so ,COMMA  after I compare 7 elements ,COMMA  if I do
not find the key ,COMMA  then I am unsuccessful in finding the search is not yielding any result .PERIOD 
The other thing is key the element for example ,COMMA  8 which I am finding out in this array of
numbers ,COMMA  right .PERIOD  Say something like this I am trying to find out 8 .PERIOD 

So now let us look at the algorithm .PERIOD  Int pos equal to 0 pos means position .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  initially I
am in this position .PERIOD  That is this array is a so ,COMMA  a 0 ,COMMA  while pos is less than size it is ,COMMA  right
now 0 it is less than size ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  the pos is not has not exceeded the last element ;SEMICOLON 
that means ,COMMA  I have not yet checked the last element .PERIOD  That is why this is said ,COMMA  and the this
pos the element a pos a pos ,COMMA  pos is the index is 5 ,COMMA  and suppose my key is 8 ,COMMA  if a pos is not
equal to key .PERIOD 
Then I will increment pos ,COMMA  I will check for the next element .PERIOD  Now look at this .PERIOD  This is an
end here .PERIOD  If either of these conditions fail ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  if I have not found it fine ,COMMA  but I
have exceeded the key exceeded the array size ,COMMA  I mean limit then I will stop .PERIOD  Or if I have
found the key 8 here ,COMMA  although I have not reached the end I will stop ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is the
condition ,COMMA  then I go on increasing pos ;SEMICOLON  if pos is less than n ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  when I come out
of this while loop ,COMMA  when any of these conditions are not satisfied .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  if pos is less than n ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  actually it should have been pos is less than sighs ok .PERIOD 
If I have come ,COMMA  if still pos is let us it should be pos is less than size .PERIOD  If pos is less than
size ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I have not come to the end of the array then ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA  why did I come
out ?QUESTIONMARK  Because this condition was false this condition was false means what ?QUESTIONMARK  I have
already found the key ,COMMA  right then I will return the position .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  pos increments from 0 to 1 to 2 ,COMMA  to 3 ,COMMA  then to 4 ,COMMA  when I do that the size was 5 ,COMMA  I have
not exceeded 5 is still less than 5 .PERIOD  And so ,COMMA  pos could be in 2 ,COMMA  but I have come out I have
come out because I found this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  at pos pos position 4 ,COMMA  I am getting the key .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  pos is
returned ,COMMA  otherwise if this is not true ,COMMA  then I will return minus 1 ,COMMA  minus 1 .PERIOD  If it is returned ;SEMICOLON 
that means ,COMMA  that I have not found the key ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is the look of the linear search
function ,COMMA  very simple .PERIOD  Now so ,COMMA  the key appears in if the key appears within this limit ,COMMA 
then I will return the pointer pos otherwise I shall return the key .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is an example say ,COMMA  this is the array x ,COMMA  12 minus 3 ,COMMA  78 ,COMMA  67 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  50 etcetera .PERIOD  I want
to trace the following calls .PERIOD  I call search so ,COMMA  if you go up the linear search ,COMMA  let me call this
is linear search .PERIOD  It should be written down as linear search .PERIOD  I am calling with the array x
all right the size of the array 8 ,COMMA  and the key is 6 ok .PERIOD  Here what will happen ?QUESTIONMARK  Size of the
array is 8 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I will start from here 12 ,COMMA  no minus 3 ,COMMA  no my key is 6 right ,COMMA  I increment pos from here
to here ,COMMA  no ,COMMA  it is not matching pos is not the key ,COMMA  a pos is not the key here a pos the key .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I come out with 0 ,COMMA  1 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  4 ,COMMA  pos value is 4 here .PERIOD  What will happen for this ?QUESTIONMARK  I the
same array x size 8 ,COMMA  but my key is 5 you can see that I will go up to this and after that I
will increment pos plus plus .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will be more than 8 .PERIOD  And so ,COMMA  the size is 8 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will
not be able to I will say that I have not got the key ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that is so ,COMMA  this one will return 4 ,COMMA  and this one will return minus 1 .PERIOD  That is how the
linear search algorithm works .PERIOD  Now let us stop here for today .PERIOD  Next ,COMMA  we will look at
another more efficient search ,COMMA  but it require that demands something more from us that
the array must be sorted in that case we can apply the binary search algorithm to make it
more efficient ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  today what we saw is how we can write as small small functions to
solve a big problem after a break down that big problem into smaller parts .PERIOD  And also ,COMMA  we
found how we can the concept of linear search which we learnt earlier ,COMMA  how we can write
a function for that ok .PERIOD 

In the earlier lecture ,COMMA  we have seen ,COMMA  how we can search in a list of items ,COMMA  may be list of
integers or may be list of names or list of real numbers in a linear way ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  we
start from one end of the list and we have got a key and we check for every element
whether the element in the list matches the key or not .PERIOD  In that way ,COMMA  we go on from top to
bottom .PERIOD  And ultimately ,COMMA  if we get the match of the key to an element of the list ,COMMA  we
declare it is found .PERIOD  And we also say where it is found .PERIOD 
Otherwise ,COMMA  if it ,COMMA  if we exhaust the list and still do not find the element ,COMMA  then we say that
the list is not found .PERIOD  And the way in which we have find searching from the top to
bottom ,COMMA  that process is known as linear search .PERIOD  We have also seen that ,COMMA  the time that time
that is required to search for an element in the best case ,COMMA  it would be of order 1 ;SEMICOLON  that
means ,COMMA  at the very beginning ,COMMA  we can find the element .PERIOD  Otherwise ,COMMA  we have to show
many comparisons ,COMMA  we have to do ?QUESTIONMARK  The minimum is 1 if we get the match at the
beginning of the top of the list .PERIOD  Otherwise ,COMMA  we have to we may have to exhaust all the
elements and whether it is found or not found .PERIOD  We can say only after we have compared
all the elements .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  if there is a list of n elements ,COMMA  the maximum number of comparisons that I may have
to do will be n .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  on an average ,COMMA  it will be n plus 1 by 2 that we say in
complexity of algorithms parlance .PERIOD  In that parlance ,COMMA  in that terminology ,COMMA  we call it order
of n ok .PERIOD  That is not the main issue with us ,COMMA  but with we can say therefore ,COMMA  that in a list of
elements ,COMMA  if I have got n elements and the list is not sorted ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  may be 5 2 7 9 11 1 ,COMMA  say ,COMMA 
this is the list and I want to search for a key .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this in this case ,COMMA  it is 6 .PERIOD  But ,COMMA  in general ,COMMA  I can say that there are n elements right .PERIOD  In
general ,COMMA  I can say number of elements is n .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the best case I can get a match here ,COMMA  the
number of comparisons I require is 1 and the worst case I have to come up to this and
compare all these n elements .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  the number of comparison on an average will be n plus 1 by 2 ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD  That is a
average number of comparisons that we denote in computer parlance as of the order of n .PERIOD 
This o is has got name called big o .PERIOD  I am sorry let me write it in this way .PERIOD  This called big
o notation big o notation .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  where it just denotes the how much time a computer can a
program will take to run ,COMMA  in terms of the input size ,COMMA  what is this n ?QUESTIONMARK  This is the size of the
input data ,COMMA  we call it input size .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  obviously ,COMMA  you can see that ,COMMA  as these list increases ,COMMA  if it becomes 100 ,COMMA  then the time
average time that will be taken average .PERIOD  This is average complexity all right ,COMMA  will be
more than this .PERIOD  If it is with 1000 even more and as increases ,COMMA  the time will increase in a
linear fashion .PERIOD  As n increases ,COMMA  the time will increase in a linear fashion .PERIOD  However ,COMMA  the
way we are searching is known as linear search .PERIOD  One thing to note is that ,COMMA  in this case ,COMMA  we
are not making any assumption .PERIOD  This is time .PERIOD  We are not making any assumption about
the way in which the data items are organized .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  in an endeavor ,COMMA  to see ,COMMA  if we can make it better ,COMMA  we today discuss another very
important type of search algorithm ,COMMA  which is known as binary search .PERIOD  Why the name
binary is coming very clear in a moment ,COMMA  but the important thing to note is that ,COMMA  in this
case ,COMMA  the list or the array must be sorted ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  it is organized in some particular
way ;SEMICOLON  either in an ascending order or in the descending order ok .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that is why ,COMMA  it is called binary .PERIOD  Let us let me just try to explain it with an example .PERIOD 
Say ,COMMA  I have got the array ,COMMA  but in a sorted way .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I have got 1 2 the elements where there in the earlier case one 2 five seven nine
eleven right 1 2 5 7 9 11 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  1 2 5 7 9 11 .PERIOD  Now suppose my key is well ,COMMA  let the key be 2 .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  we will start at middle of this array first we will look at the middle .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  since is
this is an even number ,COMMA  even sized array ,COMMA  6 elements middle can be somewhere here .PERIOD  Say ,COMMA 
let me take this ,COMMA  this is the midpoint .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  I compare the key with the middle element 2 and 7 are being compared .PERIOD  2 things
can happen ;SEMICOLON  either 2 the key I I will rather say ,COMMA  either the key is less than the mid element
or the key is equal to the mid element or the key is greater than the mid element .PERIOD  3 things
can happen .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  if the key is equal to the mid element ,COMMA  then my search immediately
stops .PERIOD  Yes ,COMMA  I found it and where did I find it ?QUESTIONMARK  The index is mid .PERIOD 
If the key is less than the mid element ,COMMA  as is the case here ,COMMA  then what can I say ?QUESTIONMARK  I can
immediately say that ,COMMA  the I still do not know whether the key is there in this array or not ,COMMA 
whether the key is here or not I do not know as here .PERIOD  But the thing that I say is ,COMMA  that the
key ,COMMA  since it is less than the mid ,COMMA  it cannot be on this side ,COMMA  it cannot be on this side .PERIOD  Not
possible .PERIOD  It must be if at all on this side ,COMMA  because ,COMMA  the key is less than the mid .PERIOD 
Therefore ,COMMA  I can restrict my search within this period .PERIOD  Suppose ,COMMA  within this zone ,COMMA  now
what I will do ?QUESTIONMARK  I will again take the middle point of this array ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  between here it
is becoming very simple .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the middle point of this part is suppose 5 .PERIOD  I could have had
it from 1 1 to 5 ,COMMA  but I am just taking from 1 to 7 .PERIOD 
I come at this point and again now I compare this element and still it is less therefore ,COMMA  am
sure that it is not in this area it must be in this zone .PERIOD  Now I again ,COMMA  only for this part  ,COMMA  I
apply again ,COMMA  I find mid element and this is here and I find that the key and the element
are matching .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is found .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  how many comparisons I needed here ?QUESTIONMARK  In this case ,COMMA  I
need it 1 2 3 comparisons .PERIOD  In the case of linear search of course ,COMMA  you could have got it
luckily here in 2 comparisons all right .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA  what would have happened if my key was 9 ?QUESTIONMARK  In the case of linear search ,COMMA  suppose ,COMMA 
the key was 9 in that case ,COMMA  in the case of linear case what would what would have
happened I would have started from here 1 comparison ,COMMA  2 comparison ,COMMA  3 comparison ,COMMA  4
comparison and the 5th comparison I would have got it right ,COMMA  on the 5th comparison I
would have got it .PERIOD  But ,COMMA  let us see what would have happened in the case of the new
search technique that we are looking at .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  again I have 1 2 5 7 9 11 and my key is 9 .PERIOD  I know that in case of linear search ,COMMA  I
needed 5 comparisons .PERIOD  What will happen here ?QUESTIONMARK  I will come to the middle point here .PERIOD  I
find that the key is greater than mid .PERIOD  This is mid .PERIOD  The key is greater than mid .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA 
I know that the key if at all cannot remain in this zone .PERIOD  This part is ruled out this part is
ruled out .PERIOD  It must be in this zone .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  again within this I find the new mid .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the new
mid comes here .PERIOD  And I find this new mid mid new this and I check this ,COMMA  now I find that
the key is equal to mid .PERIOD 
Therefore ,COMMA  I find my search completes here with this index as output .PERIOD  Now how many
comparisons I needed here ?QUESTIONMARK  1 2 only 2 comparisons .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  2 comparisons verses 1 2 3 4 5 comparisons in the case of linear search .PERIOD  Now why
was it reduced ?QUESTIONMARK  The same thing would have happened with if my key was 11 .PERIOD  Let us
have a look if the a key was 11 .PERIOD  In that case ,COMMA  suppose ,COMMA  the key was 11 ,COMMA  in the case of
linear search ,COMMA  I would have required 6 comparisons here to reach at 11 .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA  in this case ,COMMA  I would I would be sure if key is greater than is ,COMMA  then my next
iteration will be between these 2 and I would have found mid new mid and I would have
got it with 3 comparisons .PERIOD  Now why is it becoming so ?QUESTIONMARK  Why is the number of
comparison being reduced ?QUESTIONMARK  The reason is we have got this array and at every stage ,COMMA  what
I am doing is ,COMMA  am looking at the key and depending on whether the key is greater than the
mid .PERIOD 

I am concentrating on only one half of the array either this array or this array .PERIOD  And then ,COMMA 
depending on the key value ,COMMA  I take suppose it is greater ,COMMA  then I will concentrate on these
zone .PERIOD  If it is less ,COMMA  I will concentrate on this zone .PERIOD  And iteratively ,COMMA  I will be reducing my
search to a smaller array .PERIOD  Let us have another example .PERIOD 
Let us have another example .PERIOD  Let us have it a little bigger all right .PERIOD  Let us have 17 19 20
21 25 32 38 40 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now I have got again even number let me have 42 .PERIOD  Say odd number arrays 1 2 3 4 .PERIOD 
Now I have got 9 elements right .PERIOD  Now I will start with the mid element .PERIOD  What is the mid
element ?QUESTIONMARK  Here ,COMMA  between this ,COMMA  the mid element is this .PERIOD  And suppose my key is 19  ,COMMA  then I
know that ,COMMA  my key cannot lie ,COMMA  since it is less than 19 ,COMMA  it cannot lie in this part of the array .PERIOD 
If at all ,COMMA  it will lie on this part of the array .PERIOD  Why ?QUESTIONMARK  Why do I say that ?QUESTIONMARK  I can say that
because ,COMMA  this array is sorted .PERIOD 
Otherwise ,COMMA  I could not have said .PERIOD  Since it is an increasing order ,COMMA  I can say that ,COMMA  since the
key is less than the mid element ,COMMA  therefore ,COMMA  it must be in this zone .PERIOD  And so ,COMMA  I come to this
zone and find out the mid element again may be in this zone or up to this .PERIOD  Say I come
here and find out the mid element this again .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  am looking ,COMMA  I am immediately reduced
my list to half ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK  This half ,COMMA  it could have been if my key was 38 ,COMMA  then I would have
restricted to this half not this half .PERIOD  But for 19 ,COMMA  am restricted to this half .PERIOD  Now again ,COMMA  19 is
less than 20 ,COMMA  immediately I will restrict myself to this half and I will not consider this
part ,COMMA  gradually am going to the lower half or the higher half at every stage .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what is happening is something like this .PERIOD  Am starting with the whole array ,COMMA  then am
concentrating either in the left half or on the right half .PERIOD  Then again ,COMMA  depending on that ,COMMA 
either on the left half or on the right half if it is in the right half ,COMMA  then among them ,COMMA  this
am coming to left half and right half .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  at every stage ,COMMA  am dividing the array to half .PERIOD 
That is why this is called binary search .PERIOD  Either it is here or it is not here not in this zone .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  in that way ,COMMA  I carry on .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  con consequently ,COMMA  the number of elements that I restrict
my search to gets reduced at every iteration .PERIOD  Let us look at this in a little more detail .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
in every state ,COMMA  we reduce the number of elements by half .PERIOD  I think this is clear now ,COMMA  that
this statement .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  if you do not find it ,COMMA  you can ignore the half of the array and repeat
the process .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  let us look at this basics strategy .PERIOD  What do you want ?QUESTIONMARK  The array is from 0 to n
minus 1 ,COMMA  n elements .PERIOD  Here ,COMMA  I was showing mid zone only .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is the mid m and this is
the left end .PERIOD  This is the right end .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  there are 2 indexes ,COMMA  indices all right ?QUESTIONMARK  Now ,COMMA  am
taking the key and I am checking this part m .PERIOD  The element m this element ;SEMICOLON  that is ,COMMA  xm .PERIOD 
And depending on whether if it is greater than the key ,COMMA  if xm ,COMMA  if the key is greater than
xm ,COMMA  key is greater than xm is less ,COMMA  then I will be concentrating here .PERIOD  If xm is greater than
the key ,COMMA  then I will be concentrating on this half on this half or on this half .PERIOD  That is what I
was explaining till now ok .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  here ,COMMA  if it is no ,COMMA  then I will .PERIOD  If it xm is less than the key  ,COMMA  then the I will come to this
half .PERIOD  Otherwise ,COMMA  if it is less I will come to this half greater than that all right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  will first
given this L and r ,COMMA  what is my mid element ?QUESTIONMARK  How will I compute my mid element or m ?QUESTIONMARK 
This L plus R divided by 2 .PERIOD  And then ,COMMA  depending on whether it is less or greater ,COMMA  we will
we will move the left or L or R till the middle depending on the test .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  again let me
show it with a example that we are showing .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  something like this 1 2 5 7 9 11 what is being said is ,COMMA  9 11 ah .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  L is L equals 0 and
R is equal to 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  R is equal to 5 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  mid is L plus R divided by 2 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that is 5 divided by 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we can take 2 or we can take 3 depending on .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I come
to if I take 2 ,COMMA  if I take 3 ,COMMA  then am coming to mid .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what I will do is ,COMMA  if 3 is my
midpoint ,COMMA  if I take 5 by 2 is 3 ,COMMA  then ,COMMA  that means ,COMMA  it will be in case of odd I will add 1 to
that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can move .PERIOD  Now if the key is suppose ,COMMA  key is 9 suppose the key is 9 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my
mid was the 3rd .PERIOD 
It is 0 1 2 3 or let me 0 1 2 3 .PERIOD  There is my mid .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  since the key is key is greater than
the element x m x mid ,COMMA  since it is x mid is less .PERIOD  I will be restrict my search in this area .PERIOD 
Therefore ,COMMA  what I will do ?QUESTIONMARK  I will move this L to mid .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this will be my new L .PERIOD  And I
will find the mid with .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  next mid will be this new L plus R by 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will be this
element if my search was on the other side ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  if the key was not 9 ,COMMA  but the key
was 2 or 1 ,COMMA  let us make it 1 .PERIOD 
Then ,COMMA  at this point ,COMMA  I find that the key is less than x mid ,COMMA  then I will be restricting my
search in this area .PERIOD  In that case ,COMMA  I will move my R ,COMMA  I will shift this R over here ,COMMA  and this
the mid will be R ,COMMA  R will be the mid .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  next ,COMMA  I will be restricting my search in this half
and forget about this half .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is how we at every iteration ,COMMA  we break down the entire
array into halves .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if you have understood this ,COMMA  let us proceed .PERIOD  Repeat the search

operation in the reduced interval .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what we are doing is ,COMMA  we are looking at this binary
search algorithm and we are trying to design a function .PERIOD 

And finery binary search is a function ,COMMA  whose name am just keeping as bin search all
right .PERIOD  This is the name of the algorithm .PERIOD  And what are the parameters ?QUESTIONMARK  Let us see .PERIOD  The
parameters are one is the array that is being passed the list that have to search .PERIOD  I also need
the size of the array and I need the key .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  these are 3 things .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  binary search is a function .PERIOD  What are it is inputs ?QUESTIONMARK  The list or
the array which is x ,COMMA  the size or what we are calling about right now n and the key and
what will the output be ,COMMA  bin search we will tell us whether it has been found or not ok .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  it will be a 0 or 1 .PERIOD  Found or not .PERIOD  0 or 1 or it can written as an index also ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
now ,COMMA  if we proceed with this idea ,COMMA  then let us develop the algorithm step by step inside
this function .PERIOD  I have got the search .PERIOD  I have got the list the list is given to me .PERIOD 

This array is known to me .PERIOD  I declare internally L R and I have to use a another index
called mid .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  this has got no meaning outside .PERIOD  This function next step what should I
do ?QUESTIONMARK 

Next step would be while some condition mid ,COMMA  I will have to find out L plus R by 2 .PERIOD  As
you know ,COMMA  if this is the array x ,COMMA  if the mid element is greater than the keys So ,COMMA  the key ,COMMA 
say this mid element is 7 and my key is 9 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this element is greater than I know that
this element is greater .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is 17 .PERIOD  This is greater than the key .PERIOD  Then I will have to

keep my search within this zone .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this R will be updated and the R will come here .PERIOD 
Otherwise ,COMMA  L will be moved here .PERIOD  This much is clear .PERIOD  You think over this and build upon
this algorithm we will take it up in next step again ,COMMA  we have to decide on how to build
this things up .PERIOD 

We were discussing about the binary search function or binary search procedure .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here we can see that binary search is of type integer is a function of type integer that
will be returning an integer .PERIOD  And it has got the parameters the list or the array which is
being designated as x here ,COMMA  the size of the array and the key .PERIOD  Now if the key appears say ,COMMA 
the array is here ,COMMA  the array is this ,COMMA  or the list is this ,COMMA  this is called x .PERIOD  And it starts with 0 ,COMMA 
and the last one is therefore ,COMMA  whatever is in size minus 1 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  if the key there is a key ,COMMA  and if the key appears anywhere here ,COMMA  it will return the
position of the point where the key is ,COMMA  if this be the position that be returned .PERIOD  And if not
found it will return minus 1 ,COMMA  so either it will find the position send the position .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that
is also integer ,COMMA  or minus 1 hence the height is integer ,COMMA  alright .PERIOD  Now we have got 2
pointers ,COMMA  one is L the left pointer left index and the right index of this .PERIOD  And from there we
are finding out the middle .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we are finding out midpoint by this ,COMMA  like ,COMMA  now if the key is
smaller than the middle element .PERIOD 

If the key is smaller than this middle element ,COMMA  then obviously ,COMMA  our search will be on this
side .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  this R will be moved to this point .PERIOD  L will remain here and my search will
be restricted in this zone .PERIOD  Otherwise L will be moved here ,COMMA  R will not be disturbed and
the search will be restricted to this zone .PERIOD  This much has been achieved by this piece of
code ,COMMA  what else do we need ?QUESTIONMARK  What else do we need to do ?QUESTIONMARK  Now how long will this go on ?QUESTIONMARK 

So ,COMMA  in this way ,COMMA  what will happen is ,COMMA  I will move either L or R ,COMMA  either this or this ,COMMA  and
when will this be completed ,COMMA  how long will this loop go on ?QUESTIONMARK  If you think a little bit we
will find that it will go on as long as L and R are not crossing over .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I shift and
search this part R is here .PERIOD 

Suppose I so ,COMMA  I initially start with L equal to be minus 1 and R to be the size .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am
shifting from so ,COMMA  here is my array and L value of L is minus 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is here and R is
equal to size ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  pointing here size plus 1 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  sorry this point is size
minus 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is actually here ,COMMA  and while as I share ,COMMA  I shift L and I shift between this
part etcetera .PERIOD 
Then my shift L ,COMMA  R is here ;SEMICOLON  as soon as L and R crosses over ,COMMA  if R will R moves this side
then also a L and R can cross over .PERIOD  If they cross over then that is the ;SEMICOLON  that is my point
where I should stop .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I initialize this ;SEMICOLON  so ,COMMA  and I go on shifting this ,COMMA  depending on either L or R .PERIOD  That is
exactly what we are doing when we took the say 1 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  7 ,COMMA  9 ,COMMA  13 like that 15 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I start it
with the middle number ,COMMA  and when the key was suppose my key is 16 ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK  Or say .PERIOD 
Let me erase this ,COMMA  my key is say 8 ;SEMICOLON  12 .PERIOD  Suppose ,COMMA  my key is 12 ,COMMA  what will happen ?QUESTIONMARK  My L
is here ,COMMA  there is L ,COMMA  this is R ,COMMA  I start with mid is 7 so ,COMMA  key is greater than this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will
have to restrict my search in this zone I take the middle of this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  R becomes this ,COMMA  this
becomes R ,COMMA  and I am sorry ,COMMA  am sorry R remains the same .PERIOD  I have to search between this
zone ;SEMICOLON  so ,COMMA  what I do ?QUESTIONMARK  I shift L I have to search between this zone .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I shift L to this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
this is my 12 ,COMMA  and this is R I have to search in between this .PERIOD  I will find this to be the mid ,COMMA 
fine ?QUESTIONMARK  And I find that the key is less than the mid ;SEMICOLON  so ,COMMA  I will restrict my search within this
zone ,COMMA  this zone ,COMMA  within this zone right .PERIOD 
Since it is less so ,COMMA  then what should I do ?QUESTIONMARK  If since am moving on this zone ,COMMA  I will shift R
keeping L fixed I will shift R here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this will be R now ;SEMICOLON  now between this n L l and R
I find mid ,COMMA  this is my mid ok .PERIOD  I find 9 to be less than 12 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  it should be on this
side .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I move L ,COMMA  as I move L ;SEMICOLON  L is crossing R ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  now I have come to a
position where I have ex exhausted everything ,COMMA  and I could not find the key ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA  if L is greater than 0 ,COMMA  and x L is equal to key ,COMMA  L is greater than equal to 0 .PERIOD  And x L is
the is a key then I return to the point ,COMMA  otherwise return minus 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is the binary
search algorithm ok .PERIOD  This is how am carrying out the algorithm through a C code .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is an example am writing down an array .PERIOD  Suppose ,COMMA  sorry am writing down a
sorted array ,COMMA  suppose it is minus 17 ,COMMA  minus 5 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  12 ,COMMA  21 ,COMMA  45 ,COMMA  63 and 50 .PERIOD  63 it cannot be
50 ,COMMA  say this one is say this up to 63 .PERIOD  That is my array .PERIOD 
Now if I carry out so ,COMMA  the size is 1 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  4 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  7 ,COMMA  8 .PERIOD  I must have one another one .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let
me have 75 ,COMMA  and if 3 be my key this is the key .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will happen ?QUESTIONMARK  I will start L here ,COMMA 
R here ,COMMA  and I will find the midpoint here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the midpoint will be here ,COMMA  12 and 12 is
greater than the key .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my search will be within this zone ,COMMA  this R will be shifted here .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this is my now R ,COMMA  and this is L ,COMMA  I will find out midpoint 3 here now .PERIOD  As soon as I
come to this mid ,COMMA  and I find that this mid is matching the key my search is found ,COMMA  all
right ?QUESTIONMARK  I get I get my key in a particular position .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  you can write it in different ways .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  in this way ,COMMA  if I do that ,COMMA  then I will get
different results .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  minus 17 I will just missed out minus 5 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  12 ,COMMA  21 ,COMMA  45 ,COMMA  63 and 75 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  if for this ,COMMA  my L was at minus 1 R was at 9 ,COMMA  and I my mid was this x 4 12 ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  then
x 1 is minus 5 .PERIOD  I carry on doing this .PERIOD  L is still 1 ,COMMA  R is 4 ,COMMA  R has been shifted to here .PERIOD  And x
2 is 3 ,COMMA  I found it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that is my result ,COMMA  in that way I will carry out and you can find out that L and R and
then I returned .PERIOD  L I go on shifting .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is what it has happened .PERIOD  I have got the mid
value ,COMMA  and I have got the value ,COMMA  but then still am going on shifting .PERIOD  You can you can also ,COMMA 
what I have suggesting is ,COMMA  it is also possible to check the equality with the x mid as soon
as I find that the element has matched with the mid then it is found .PERIOD 

I think you have understood it you can try writing out the algorithm yourself these are
binary search we will see later that it can be also done through recursion .PERIOD 
Now why are you doing so much ?QUESTIONMARK  Earlier ,COMMA  linear search was very much simple ,COMMA  right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Here suppose we had thousand elements ,COMMA  if we had thousand elements ,COMMA  then the ordinary
search if a key may key is the member of x ,COMMA  it would on an average require on an average
it would have required 500 comparisons on an average .PERIOD  But what will happen in the case
of binary system search ?QUESTIONMARK  After the first compare 1000 elements .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  we are left with only 500 elements ,COMMA  because I start it from I start it with an array ,COMMA  and
then based on that I have either gone on this half of the array or this half of the array
depending on whether the key is less than or greater than the midpoint this is the mid .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
on an average first compare I am left with 500 elements .PERIOD  Next compare this part is again
divided if it is on this side am left with 250 elements ,COMMA  right .PERIOD  After at most 10 steps ,COMMA  we
are done in that way I go on dividing it and after at most 10 steps I am done .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I have thousand elements ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can so ,COMMA  in that way I get 250 elements ,COMMA  and 125 ,COMMA 
125 ;SEMICOLON  then half of that 60 ,COMMA  65 or something like that .PERIOD 

In that way ,COMMA  number of steps that I will be following will be around 10 .PERIOD  In general ,COMMA  if
there are n elements in the array ,COMMA  number of searches required is 2 to the power k should
be n ,COMMA  where k is number of steps ok .PERIOD  For n if there be 64 .PERIOD  Initially ,COMMA  the list is 60 the size is
64 ,COMMA  after first comparison list is 32 .PERIOD  After second it is 16 ,COMMA  then 8 ,COMMA  then 4 ,COMMA  then 2 and then 1
so ,COMMA  6 steps .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  basically at every step am breaking it down into half .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  if I need
the k steps .PERIOD 

Then ,COMMA  if I need k steps ,COMMA  then 2 to the power k should be equal to n ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  how many
steps are there ?QUESTIONMARK  How many ,COMMA  what is k if I take log and k log log k k log 2 is equal to n .PERIOD 
Therefore ,COMMA  k will be log 2 n to the power base of log 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  log 2 ,COMMA  log 64 to the base 2 is
6 .PERIOD  We will be completing in 6 steps .PERIOD  Whereas ,COMMA  in the worst case I would have needed 64
comparisons in the case if linear search .PERIOD  Now given this idea of binary search .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  what have you seen ?QUESTIONMARK  We have seen binary search is a search algorithm ,COMMA  that enables
us to search for an element much faster ,COMMA  than linear search the approach being that we
divide the array to be searched in half every time .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we divide it into half and restrict
our search in half ,COMMA  and in the next step I further divide it into 2 half and restrict it to even
a smaller steps .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  every time am halving whatever array am checking .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  2 days to the power k time
by half date where k times have half date 2 days to the power k should cover the entire n .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA  from there we get the complexity to be of log of log 2 log n to the base 2 log n to
the base 2 in general it will be log if 64 is replaced with n (Refer Time: 15:43) then it
should be log n to the base 2 ,COMMA  that is my time complexity compared to .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can say this
order of log n to the base 2 ,COMMA  compared to order of n ,COMMA  that was the case in the case of a in
the case of linear search .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  we will move to another very fundamental problem in programming .PERIOD  We often
need that say for example ,COMMA  here we have done one thing that is ,COMMA  I had a array like say 2 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA 
7 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  1 ,COMMA  9 .PERIOD 

Now this was an array ,COMMA  on which I cannot run binary search .PERIOD  Why I cannot run binary
search ?QUESTIONMARK  Because binary search can be done only on sorted array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I sort it ,COMMA  either in
increasing or decreasing order .PERIOD  Say ,COMMA  for example ,COMMA  it becomes 1 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  7 ,COMMA  9 .PERIOD  This is a
sorted array ,COMMA  or the other thing could be 9 ,COMMA  7 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  3 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  1 .PERIOD  These also a sorted array .PERIOD  In the
other direction ,COMMA  it is descending order this is the ascending order ok .PERIOD 
So now another problem is ,COMMA  to arrange the things arrange the objects ,COMMA  suppose they are
number of numbers like this .PERIOD  We have to arrange them ,COMMA  sorted or arranged in a particular
way .PERIOD  The question is ,COMMA  how to do sorting ,COMMA  how to sort ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  suppose I have given this array
to my program ,COMMA  this is the input .PERIOD  Then if I want to apply binary search ,COMMA  then I cannot
directly apply it apply binary search on this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what I can do ?QUESTIONMARK  I can first take the array
say I read the array let me write .PERIOD 

Then sort the array ,COMMA  and then read key apply binary search .PERIOD  Now binary search takes for n
number of elements it will be faster .PERIOD  But how do we sort the array ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  it is faster than
linear search ,COMMA  but is it advisable to approach in this way if the array is not sort ,COMMA  is it
advisable to sort the array and then apply binary search ?QUESTIONMARK  In order to understand this ,COMMA  we
have to first see how an array can be sorted ,COMMA  how an array can be arranged in either
increasing or decreasing order .PERIOD 
That is also a very important problem that is called the sorting problem .PERIOD  And this has got
very important I mean application ,COMMA  in many of many of objects whenever I so ,COMMA  for
example ,COMMA  for example ,COMMA  you have got the marks of the students ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK  The you have
got a marks array hm .PERIOD 

Say ,COMMA  you have got 2-dimensional matrix may be where ,COMMA  all right ,COMMA  let us take one
dimensional one dimensional array ;SEMICOLON  where ,COMMA  the roll numbers are here ,COMMA  every row is
corresponding to a roll number .PERIOD  And here I think ,COMMA  I will I will just do it again .PERIOD  I have got
the marks here ;SEMICOLON  56 ,COMMA  50 ,COMMA  65 ,COMMA  70 etcetera ,COMMA  etcetera .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  I want to find what is the highest marks .PERIOD  One thing is that I can find that ,COMMA  out or I
want to attribute ranks ,COMMA  first second third like that .PERIOD  In that case I can sort this array ,COMMA  and
from here I want to have an array like this ;SEMICOLON  where the first element will be 7 ,COMMA  the second
element will be 65 ,COMMA  then 56 ,COMMA  then 50 .PERIOD  This also sorting the marks .PERIOD  In a decreasing order ,COMMA 
and along with that I can also sort the roll numbers ,COMMA  and can publish which roll number
got marks right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what we want to see next is sorting .PERIOD 

Let us define the basic problem first .PERIOD  Sorting means given an array like 0 to some size
minus 1 reorder the entries so that they are in this way ;SEMICOLON  that x 1 is greater than equal to x
0 x 2 greater than equal to x 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if it be this sorry ,COMMA  why is this greater than equal to
coming up ?QUESTIONMARK  If for example ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  7 ,COMMA  9 ;SEMICOLON  this also sorted array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  both these
elements could have taken any order ,COMMA  but since they are same they can be assumed to be
sorted .PERIOD  That is why this greater than equal to thing that is coming up .PERIOD 

The list here is in non-decreasing order ,COMMA  non-decreasing .PERIOD  I cannot say increasing order
because it is not increasing 2 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  6 ,COMMA  7 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here of course ,COMMA  there was an increase ,COMMA 
but here there is no increase .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is rather instead of calling it increasing order ,COMMA  we
can call it non-decreasing order .PERIOD  A list of elements in non-increasing order it is not
decreasing order .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can also sort it in the other way as it shown earlier .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is an example ,COMMA  this is sorted in non-decreasing order ,COMMA  you can see this array .PERIOD  10 ,COMMA 
30 now this original list .PERIOD  Now if I sort them in non-decreasing order it will 10 minus 10 ,COMMA 
10 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  30 ,COMMA  40 ,COMMA  60 ,COMMA  70 ,COMMA  72 ,COMMA  70s ,COMMA  80 .PERIOD  And if I do it in a non-increasing order ,COMMA  then minus
80 ,COMMA  70 ,COMMA  70 in this way .PERIOD  This is not increasing in this way ,COMMA  here it is not increasing ,COMMA  all
right ?QUESTIONMARK  Here it is not decreasing if I go in this direction .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these are the 2 possibilities .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the sorting problem is ,COMMA  if we have an array from 0 to size minus 1 ,COMMA  I want to sort it
and get a sorted list ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK 

That is what I want to have .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the first algorithm that will be talking about is selection
sort .PERIOD  Selection sort is something like this .PERIOD  That suppose we have got a list here and this
part of the array is already sorted ,COMMA  this part of the array is sorted in a non-decreasing
order .PERIOD  This already the smallest element is here ,COMMA  the smallest element minus 10 ,COMMA  then 10 ,COMMA 
then 20 .PERIOD  This part is somehow as sorted .PERIOD  Now am less left with sorting this part only this

remainder .PERIOD  What should I do ?QUESTIONMARK  I am going to select the candidate for this position ,COMMA  right .PERIOD 
Am going to select the candidate for this position .PERIOD  For that what shall I do ?QUESTIONMARK  I will start
since part is sort ,COMMA  all the elements of this side or either equal to this or less than this .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I will have to look at this part ,COMMA  and find out minimum element that is here .PERIOD  This
element that is minimum ,COMMA  since this part is sorted ,COMMA  this element this element must be
greater than this elements .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  among these ,COMMA  only for these people this one is the smallest .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I select that I select that ,COMMA  and put it in this position I swap how do I do that ?QUESTIONMARK  Suppose
here it was ,COMMA  it was minus 10 ,COMMA  10 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  30 .PERIOD  And here it was 50 ,COMMA  this point ,COMMA  this part is sorted .PERIOD 
50 ,COMMA  32 ,COMMA  72 ,COMMA  31 .PERIOD  Now I remember this position ,COMMA  and search from here and find out the
minimum .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this 31 comes I swap it here .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  what happens to my array ?QUESTIONMARK  This part ,COMMA  let us see what it will happen .PERIOD  It will now
become from here it was 30 it will be 31 ,COMMA  32 ,COMMA  72 ,COMMA  50 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  up to this part it is sorted now .PERIOD 
Now form here I will try to find out the minimum element .PERIOD  I find this is the minimum
element .PERIOD  And I sort out the minimum element .PERIOD  I swap this minimum element with itself .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  up to this is sorted .PERIOD  Out of these now I have to find out the candidate for this position .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I find out the minimum I come here and swap this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it becomes 50 ,COMMA  72 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here in
this selection sort the approach is that we have to we have to we are going position by
position .PERIOD  And I am selecting the element that belongs to that particular position .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
whenever am starting with the search then at the beginning I am having am starting with
the if this be my array .PERIOD 

Then am first searching for this position .PERIOD  And this position will have will be the
minimum of all these .PERIOD  I search all through here ,COMMA  and find the minimum suppose the
minimum must 10 was here .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I take and bring this minus 10 here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it becomes minus 10 I know this is the
minimum .PERIOD  Now am sorting am now looking for this position .PERIOD  I select the element ,COMMA 
minimum element in this zone .PERIOD  I find here something 10 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this part is done .PERIOD  So now ,COMMA 
10 is swapped here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  10 ,COMMA  10 and then this part is unsorted .PERIOD  This part I will sort .PERIOD  In this
we way we go on .PERIOD  This is one of the sorting approaches .PERIOD  We will deal with it further in
the next lecture .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we were discussing about sorting .PERIOD  And in particular we were discussing about ,COMMA  one
sorting technique which is a selection sort .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in selection sort what do we do we have
got an array .PERIOD 

And of size ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  that means ,COMMA  the index is 0 to size minus 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what we do ?QUESTIONMARK  We some
parts we assume that some parts are sorted .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first thing that we do is find the smallest
element .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if from 0 to k is sorted already in the order .PERIOD  Then my job is to sort from k to
size minus 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what we do the step is ,COMMA  that we find the smallest element minimum
value in the list x from k to size minus 1 ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD  I find the minimum value ,COMMA  and then
swap the that minimum value with the k th position ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  this position ,COMMA  with this
position I carry out here in this position I bring the minimum value .PERIOD  And these goes on
and then increase k ,COMMA  k will be increased to the next position .PERIOD  And in this way ,COMMA  I will be go
going on .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the sub problem is the sub problem is to find the minimum element .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I go here
as we have seen in the ,COMMA  I mean in this array ,COMMA  my task is to find the minimum position ok .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  where is say this part ,COMMA  this part is already sorted ,COMMA  I am sitting here ,COMMA  and this is my k th
position ,COMMA  right .PERIOD  This my k th position ,COMMA  and I want to find the minimum where is the
minimum value ok .PERIOD  Where is the m value ,COMMA  minimum value where ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  for that ,COMMA  this is the
function to find the minimum location in the array x ,COMMA  and starting from this location k ,COMMA  up
to the loc up to the location size minus 1 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I need to needs know size ,COMMA  I need to need need to know k .PERIOD  That is how we are giving
the parameters ,COMMA  as we had explained in functions .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  at every point ,COMMA  you look at how the
functions are written that will help you revising this ok .PERIOD  Now the body of the function ,COMMA  x
pos will be the smallest element found so far .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  initially I am making pos to be k .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  x pos is this point ,COMMA  now from k plus 1 to up to size I go on checking ,COMMA  whether this x j
this position is less than this position .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I find out in this way ,COMMA  here I find the minimum
right ,COMMA  just see if you can understand the code .PERIOD  And find the minimum in between k plus 1
to size minus 1 .PERIOD  In between this am trying to find the minimum .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  whenever I get the
minimum am I will be returning that particular position .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is the position that I will
be returning this position ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what would be my full algorithm therefore ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  I have
got a function ,COMMA  I have got this function ,COMMA  min loc ,COMMA  which will return with the minimum
location .PERIOD 

Now so ,COMMA  it will yield with the location of the smallest element .PERIOD 

So now you see a selection sort ,COMMA  main sorting function will be this .PERIOD  It takes the array and
the size ok .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this is my array x ,COMMA  and this is the size .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will have to work between 0 to size
minus 1 .PERIOD  I have got 2 intermediate variables k and m .PERIOD  For k equal to 0 to k size minus 1 ,COMMA 
what am I doing ?QUESTIONMARK  First am starting with this ,COMMA  this element ;SEMICOLON  that is k equal to 0 .PERIOD  And what
am I doing ?QUESTIONMARK  I am finding out from k in the array x up to size I am finding the minimum

location .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  suppose here is the minimum .PERIOD  Then I am what am I doing here ?QUESTIONMARK  Temp is
going to ak .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this k is going to temp .PERIOD  And this ak is being returned by am this is the
minimum is coming here ,COMMA  and then this temp is going here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here what am I doing is ,COMMA  I
am swapping x my array was internally I called the here there is a small mistake I can
find .PERIOD  It should be xk ,COMMA  all this should be x ,COMMA  all right because I am dealing with x .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  xk will get x minimum m because and vice versa and this y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is happening
here let us see .PERIOD 

Suppose my array was something like this 50 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  70 ,COMMA  10 ,COMMA  100 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am first this is my k
equal to 1 .PERIOD  I want to bring the minimum at this position .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what I do ?QUESTIONMARK  I from here I start
searching for the minimum .PERIOD  I find tenth with the minimum ,COMMA  then I swap here is this piece
of code ,COMMA  I swap I bring 10 here ,COMMA  and 20 ,COMMA  70 remains and 50 I take here .PERIOD  And then what do
I do ?QUESTIONMARK  K is incremented so now k is here .PERIOD  Now I find min loc if what is the minimum here
compared less than this or not there is none so ,COMMA  fine next .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this remains next I increment this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is also in position ,COMMA  this is in position ,COMMA 
because it need not be exchanged next my k is increased here at this step ,COMMA  k plus plus it
has been increased here .PERIOD  I find the minimum in this area ;SEMICOLON  I find this to be the minimum .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  what is happening ?QUESTIONMARK  10 was in place ,COMMA  20 was in place ,COMMA  I swap 50 and 70 here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  50
comes here I find the minimum ,COMMA  70 remains here ,COMMA  100 remains here .PERIOD  Now I change my k

and see if there is any minimum left here at the min location is not returning me
anything .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  therefore ,COMMA  I get this to be my sorted array ok .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this is what so ,COMMA  you can see that so in this way we can ,COMMA  sorry ,COMMA  here is an example you
see here .PERIOD 

The example you see here ,COMMA  I start with this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  3 is the minimum ,COMMA  I can see here 12
minus 5 6 etcetera I can see ,COMMA  minus 17 is the minimum .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I find out minus 17 here I
swap that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  minus 17 comes here ,COMMA  and 3 goes to the place of minus 17 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these 2
now 12 ,COMMA  12 and I find the minimum from 12 onwards ,COMMA  I find minus 5 to be the minimum .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that one will come here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  minus 5 comes here ,COMMA  and 12 is swapped there .PERIOD  Now
within this part I find the minimum ,COMMA  minimum is 3 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  3 will be swapped with 12 ,COMMA  and
12 goes there in the place of 3 you see .PERIOD  Now so ,COMMA  I start with 6 ,COMMA  I start finding the
minimum .PERIOD  6 is the minimum fine .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it remains I increase k .PERIOD  So now ,COMMA  142 ,COMMA  in this way ,COMMA  I
go on from here ,COMMA  who is the minimum for starting from 142 ?QUESTIONMARK  12 is the minimum .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  12 and 142 will swapped 12 ,COMMA  and 142 has been swapped .PERIOD  Next 21 ,COMMA  21 within this 21 ,COMMA 
142 ,COMMA  45 ,COMMA  21 is the minimum .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  I keep it in place .PERIOD  Next is I take 142 and 45 ,COMMA  I
find that 45 is minimum I swap that ,COMMA  and 142 goes there .PERIOD  Next is 142 is the ,COMMA  that is the
sorted array that we get .PERIOD  This is what is known as selection sort .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the philosophy of
selection sort is ,COMMA  that am selecting the minimum element among the unsorted elements

and placing it in the position proper position where that minimum element should be ;SEMICOLON 
that is why we are selecting and putting it so ,COMMA  that is why it is known as selection sort .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  how many steps are needed to sort n things here ?QUESTIONMARK  If I do this ,COMMA  how many steps am I
taking .PERIOD  You see ,COMMA  how many steps am I taking ?QUESTIONMARK  All through here if you look at this ,COMMA  how
many steps am I taking ?QUESTIONMARK  If the list size of the list was n then the total number of steps
that are required is proportional to n square ,COMMA  because for every element why it is why it is
so ?QUESTIONMARK  Let us try to understand this .PERIOD 
The reason is that for every position ,COMMA  how many positions are there ?QUESTIONMARK  1 2 3 like that ,COMMA  there
are n positions .PERIOD  Now for every position ,COMMA  for this position ,COMMA  how many comparisons I need
to find out the minimum ?QUESTIONMARK  N minus 1 comparisons n comparisons for all these ,COMMA  next I
increment it here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  how many do I need ?QUESTIONMARK  I need for each of these for n ,COMMA  for n such
elements for each of them I need n comparisons then n plus for this I need n minus 1
comparisons ,COMMA  then I need n minus 2 comparisons ,COMMA  then I need n minus 3 comparisons in
this way for example ,COMMA  for this n 1 2 3 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  n minus 4 comparisons I need in this part ,COMMA  I
have to compare between these things .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in that way I go on .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  for every so ,COMMA  for each
of them I need to compare this ,COMMA  right for n such things ,COMMA  I have to do this ,COMMA  n n plus m n
plus 1 n minus times n .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that will be the order of n square if I find the product ,COMMA  right .PERIOD 

And number of comparison total number of steps and number of comparisons is again ,COMMA  n
into n minus 1 by 2 like as I said n minus 1 comparisons plus n minus 2 comparisons ,COMMA 
last one is one comparison .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if you add this one to n minus 1 is n into n minus 1 by 2 ,COMMA 
you know that ,COMMA  and that is of the order of n square ,COMMA  if I break it up it will be n square
minus n by 2 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that is again of the order of n square of the order of we write it as of the order of n
square all right .PERIOD 

Now next we come to another sorting algorithm ,COMMA  which is known as insertion sort .PERIOD  What
is the general situation ?QUESTIONMARK  Again ,COMMA  just like the selection sort ,COMMA  we have got the smallest
element sort ;SEMICOLON  it from 0 to this point is sorted .PERIOD  The remaining is unsorted ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD  Now
what we do is we compare and shift till xi is larger ok ,COMMA  I go on shifting .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  what I do is I start with this element ,COMMA  and I put this in the proper position ,COMMA  I insert this
in the proper position I .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I move this in this side or in this side ,COMMA  and I will come to the
proper position of this element ,COMMA  this element is being put since it is smaller the smallest
elements is sorted .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am taking this ,COMMA  and I am putting it in the place where it should
belong because I have not seen up to this .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  insert sort is something like this let us see if I can show you a example first .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  what am doing is ,COMMA  I am comparing and shifting ,COMMA  till xi is larger .PERIOD  I am continuously
shifting the elements ,COMMA  in this way I go on shifting this .PERIOD  Ultimately xi will be larger than
all these elements .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  therefore ,COMMA  my sorted position will be up to this ,COMMA  this is larger right .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I am sorry ,COMMA  I just went the other side other way .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us study this algorithm .PERIOD  This
algorithm is void ,COMMA  why it is void ?QUESTIONMARK  Because it is not returning anything it is taking the
array and is sorting this is taking this array and this sorting this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is type is void it is
taking a list and it is size .PERIOD  Now for I equal to 1 to size ,COMMA  I am taking item to the list I .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I
have got elements like say 12 ,COMMA  7 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  17 ,COMMA  9 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first I am taking I is one so ,COMMA  am taking this
element .PERIOD  This is the item .PERIOD  For js now I am looking at you see j equals I minus 1 ,COMMA  and j is

greater than 0 and list .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is not am I am not going into this side .PERIOD  I will have to go in
these direction ,COMMA  what is this mean ?QUESTIONMARK  I start with ji minus 1 ,COMMA  and go till j is greater than
equal to 0 ,COMMA  and the list is greater than I/ .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  all right so ,COMMA  my I is here ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I am not I am going till the end of this array on
the other side ,COMMA  I am going on the other side .PERIOD  And I shift what was my j here ,COMMA  j plus 1 and
the list are being swapped .PERIOD  So now ,COMMA  it will become 7 ,COMMA  12 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  17 ,COMMA  9 .PERIOD  Now and then in that
way I go on shifting ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD  So now ,COMMA  if I come here ,COMMA  I increment I after one item so ,COMMA  I
will come 5 and 5 .PERIOD  I will go on checking ,COMMA  what is the proper place of 5 ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  it will be 5
will be swapped with this 12 ,COMMA  7 ,COMMA  17 ,COMMA  9 .PERIOD  In that way I will try to find out every each of
these is for proper position .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I think we can go for a more popular sort .PERIOD 

Let us go to the more popular sort ,COMMA  I think that will be better selection sort you have
learnt insertion sort is another form .PERIOD  But let us learn the more popular one that is the
bubble sort .PERIOD  Bubble sort as the name implies .PERIOD  It starts from the bottom ,COMMA  and the minimum
element is pushed up to the ,COMMA  how is that done ?QUESTIONMARK  Just as a bubble floats up from the bottom
and goes to the top the minimum element should be pushed up the minimum element
should be pushed up to the top .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  let us see how it happens .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I first compare between these 2 elements ,COMMA  then these 2
elements ,COMMA  and in this way ,COMMA  I go on comparing between each of them and push it up ok .PERIOD  in
every iteration ,COMMA  the heaviest element drops at the bottom .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is happening is so ,COMMA  if I

go here from the top ,COMMA  I try to find out if this element ,COMMA  if this particular element ,COMMA  I am sorry
this particular element is heavier than this particular element .PERIOD  Then this particular
element should go at the top and this should come down here ,COMMA  all right ?QUESTIONMARK  Next ,COMMA  I compare
sorry ,COMMA  next I compare what is happening ?QUESTIONMARK  Next ,COMMA  I compare between this so ,COMMA  this was
shows the heavy element .PERIOD  And I find that this is not an heavy element .PERIOD  It is this heavier
than this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this may be more heavier if much heavier than this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is not pushed
out ok ,COMMA  remains .PERIOD  Now next I compare between this ,COMMA  and every time I am making the same
mistake may be this is the heavier ,COMMA  lighter element .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this lighter element will go up ,COMMA 
and this heavier element will come down .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  it will be something like this ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in this way in one direction ultimately
what I will do ?QUESTIONMARK  I will have the heaviest element at the bottom ,COMMA  and all the elements here
are lighter than this ,COMMA  this element lighter than this element ,COMMA  but these elements are not
sorted .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what I will do ?QUESTIONMARK  I will restrict my next iteration within this zone ,COMMA  and again
start between this elements ,COMMA  and see whichever is heavier that will be pushed down .PERIOD  Am I
clear ?QUESTIONMARK 
You see ,COMMA  every time I am comparing between these and am pushing that down .PERIOD  I think it
will be clearer in a moment .PERIOD  Every iteration the heaviest element drops at the bottom and
the bottom this part is done and the bottom moves upward .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  next time onwards my
search will be restricted between this zone ,COMMA  this zone to the top and the heaviest will
come to the next time my search will be restricted to this zone like that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the heaviest
here ,COMMA  next heaviest here ,COMMA  next heaviest here ,COMMA  heaviest here ,COMMA  next heaviest here ,COMMA  next
heaviest here ,COMMA  like that it will go on .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I want to see if I can give an example first .PERIOD 

Yeah ,COMMA  so ,COMMA  what is happening here is ,COMMA  say this was an unsorted array .PERIOD  The heaviest one has
been first pushed down this 89 was the heaviest one .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  by piece by piece comparison I have pushed it down .PERIOD  Next time I was restricted to
this part of the array 89 has been pushed down .PERIOD  So and let me try to show you .PERIOD 

That say ,COMMA  suppose I have got an array like this 50 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  30 ,COMMA  40 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first I compare
between these 2 ,COMMA  16 50 is heavier .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I come here next ,COMMA  I compare between these 2 50
and 20 ,COMMA  50 is heavier .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  20 comes here 50 comes here .PERIOD  Now 50 and 30 ,COMMA  50 is heavier .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  30 ,COMMA  50 and then 50 and 40 so ,COMMA  I compare this .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it becomes 450 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in one turn
what do I get now I get 16 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  30 ,COMMA  40 ,COMMA  50 now it was search the many things are sorted
only one was in out of order so ,COMMA  that is been done .PERIOD  But suppose this was let me let me just
change it ,COMMA  it becomes became too easy .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  suppose it is 25 ,COMMA  then after this swap ,COMMA  this
became 25 and 50 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have this array .PERIOD  Now I again check between this 2 .PERIOD  Heavier is in
place ,COMMA  I check between this 2 ,COMMA  no issue heavier in place ,COMMA  I check between this 2 .PERIOD 
So now what will happen ?QUESTIONMARK  25 will come here ,COMMA  and 30 being heavier will come here .PERIOD  And
30 and I need not compare any further .PERIOD  I can because this is this I know is the heaviest .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  what do I have now ?QUESTIONMARK  16 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  30 not 30 ,COMMA  30 has been swapped 25 ,COMMA  30 .PERIOD  I again compare
between this 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  there is no change ,COMMA  as soon as I find that ,COMMA  there is no interchange ;SEMICOLON  that
means ,COMMA  all this things are in order .PERIOD  This is the idea of the selection sorry the bubble sort .PERIOD 
Every time the minimum is shifting going to the bottom .PERIOD  Or I could have done it in the
other way I could have justified the name of the bubble sort ,COMMA  if I had taken the lowest
element ,COMMA  and pushed it up ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  quickly if we look at the algorithm a little bit .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we have got this is a bubble sort algorithm .PERIOD  Let us see ,COMMA  now in order to explain this ,COMMA  I
will need sometime ,COMMA  because here we are using some new ideas ,COMMA  star x and star y .PERIOD  I think
I will take it up in separate lecture ,COMMA  and discuss this separately ,COMMA  all right .PERIOD  But just as I had
explained now ,COMMA  the way the bubble sort works ,COMMA  I will just give you one more example to

show how a bubble sort works .PERIOD  And then in the next lecture ,COMMA  I will show you the
algorithm because that will require some more explanation .PERIOD 

Let us say ,COMMA  I have got this 30 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will be hap happening in the first
iteration ?QUESTIONMARK  30 will be compared with 20 ,COMMA  30 is heavier .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it would 20 ,COMMA  30 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  2 .PERIOD  Now
30 will be compared with 5 ,COMMA  what will happen and this will be swapped .PERIOD  30 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  2 .PERIOD  30 will
be compared with 16 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will happen ?QUESTIONMARK  25 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  30 2 and 30 is again greater than 2 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  25 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  30 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  25 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  30 by that I get this 30 at the bottom ,COMMA  I now I start with
again ;SEMICOLON  25 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  2 right .PERIOD 

So now ,COMMA  I have got 30 is at the bottom 25 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  2 .PERIOD  And 30 is already in proper place ,COMMA  here I
will swap .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what will happen ?QUESTIONMARK  5 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  2 then 20 will and 16 so ,COMMA  it will be 5 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA 
2 ,COMMA  then 5 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  20 is in the proper place .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  30 and 20 are in proper place .PERIOD  And 5 ,COMMA 
16 ,COMMA  2 I will have to handle .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what will be there ?QUESTIONMARK  5 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  16 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  and here I have got 20 ,COMMA  and 30 already in the
proper place sort it .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here 5 and 16 no change ,COMMA  16 and 2 there will be some change .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 

5 ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA  16 so ,COMMA  16 is in the proper place .PERIOD  So now ,COMMA  between 5 and 2 so ,COMMA  my thing will be 16 ,COMMA 
20 ,COMMA  30 are in place .PERIOD 

16 ,COMMA  20 ,COMMA  30 are in place ,COMMA  and 5 and 2 I have to deal with ,COMMA  these are fine .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my pointers are
changing ,COMMA  right ,COMMA  between these 2 now 5 is heavier .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will be 2 ,COMMA  5 ,COMMA  5 is in the proper
place .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  2 5 in the proper place ,COMMA  16 proper place ,COMMA  20 proper place ,COMMA  30 proper place .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
only 2 there is no question of swapping .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I get the complete sorted file ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is
the principle of bubble sort ,COMMA  I will be explaining the algorithm the code in the next class .PERIOD 
In the meanwhile ,COMMA  you can think of you can read book and you can try to see look at this
code and the algorithm yourself .PERIOD  I will discuss it in the next week lecture .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we were discussing about the Bubble Sort Algorithm and the approach as was discussed in
the last class was that every element ,COMMA  every iteration pushes the heavier element at the bottom
and the lighter elements therefore ,COMMA  goes go up .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we had shown an example a couple of examples by which we can show that the heavier
elements go down and the other lighter elements go up  ,COMMA  we had given a number of examples to
that effect .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  if there be 50 here I do not know this visible ,COMMA  let me write it here 50 here and 6 here and say
12 here and 7 here then what will happen is 50 will be swapped with 6 because 50 is heavier than
6 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  larger than 6 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first it will be 6 and 50 and then 50 will be compared with 12 again there
will be a swap .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  there will be 12 ,COMMA 50 .PERIOD  50 will be compared with 7 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will be 7 ,COMMA  50 in that
way ultimately the 50 if it is heaviest will come at the bottom .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we swap only if the element at the top is heavier there by heaviest element is coming to the
top and the others which are less than this heaviest element will be going at the top ,COMMA  the bottom
moves upward .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  we are going to write the algorithm for this or the program ,COMMA  for this before
writing the program we need to understand a very interesting and fundamental concept of C
programming that is pointers .PERIOD 

We will not formally introduce pointers here ,COMMA  but we will be talking about pointers in a different
way in a context of this bubble sort .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  what is a pointer ?QUESTIONMARK  Pointer is something that points .PERIOD 
Now suppose there is a variable here ,COMMA suppose the variable is named v and till now we have seen
that we can write declare the variable as int v .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  v has got a particular address may be that
address is 1000 ,COMMA  1000 is the address of v .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  if I say int v equals 50 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  in the address
1000 50 is written .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  suppose we have got this address v and which is an integer .PERIOD 

But I am not declaring v as such ,COMMA  but there is another variable p ,COMMA  which will always point to some
integer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  p will point to this v .PERIOD  P is pointing at this v .PERIOD  In that case I can say p is a pointer to v
now .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  therefore ,COMMA  what did I say ?QUESTIONMARK I said that v is stored in the location 1000 ,COMMA  now pointer p this
variable p therefore ,COMMA  stores the value 1000 .PERIOD 

Now this v is of type integer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  v is a pointer to an integer v that we know because I have
earlier said that v is an integer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can very well say int v ,COMMA  but what is the type of p  ,COMMA  p is a
pointer to v ,COMMA  which is an integer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we write that as int star p ,COMMA  what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK  It means that
p is a pointer to an integer ,COMMA  if I write it  ,COMMA it is not concerned with v only .PERIOD  It says that p is a pointer
to an integer .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what is the value of p now ?QUESTIONMARK  Value of p is 1000 .PERIOD  What is the address of p the address of p ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now where is this p  ?QUESTIONMARK This is in location 1000 and where is this  ?QUESTIONMARK This might be in location 2000 .PERIOD 
Therefore ,COMMA  what is the address of p ?QUESTIONMARK  &of p is 2000 ,COMMA  we know that this and operator gives us the
address ,COMMA  we have encountered this during scan f when we were discussing about scan f right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  let us have this diagram to understand the concept of pointer suppose there are different
things written in different pages of the book .PERIOD 

This 1 page ,COMMA  this is another page  ,COMMA this is another page and this is another page ,COMMA  each of these
pages have got a page number .PERIOD  Now I have got a table where suppose- this has got some content a ,COMMA  this has got some other story b ,COMMA  this has got some other story c ,COMMA  this has got some other story d .PERIOD 

Therefore ,COMMA  the content of each of this pages are the stories a ,COMMA  b ,COMMA  c ,COMMA  or d .PERIOD But which page I am
looking at  ?QUESTIONMARK Suppose here is a table of page numbers .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have got a 4 pages .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the pages are 1 2 3 4 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  suppose I just want to come to this page number .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this page number does not tell me what story is there ,COMMA  but this page number tells me that I have to go to this page .PERIOD  This entry is telling me ,COMMA  this particular page number is telling me that ,COMMA  I have to go to this page .PERIOD This is telling me that I have to go to this page and this is telling me that I have to go to this page .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what are these ?QUESTIONMARK  What are these things ?QUESTIONMARK  These are nothing ,COMMA  but pointers to pages and what is a is a content of the page .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a b c or d say is content of page 4 and these are pointers to the pages ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  if I want to go to page 4- where should I go ?QUESTIONMARK  Because this page may be
located at some other table may be ,COMMA  suppose this pages of a book are torn out and have been kept on different tables ok .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  page number 1 is giving me the table address .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that it is on this particular table .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it can
be on table t 1 ,COMMA  this can be on table t 2 ,COMMA  may be the third page is on table t 4 and this is on table t 5
it is possible .PERIOD  If I want to read the first page I will come here -the first entry this is the point in to
table t 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  and I go to table t 1 and to find this particular page and read the content in that  .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
these are pointers to pages ,COMMA  but these pointers also have to be in some memory location -let me
draw the diagram in different way now  ,COMMA suppose this is my memory and I have got 4 variables .PERIOD 

Suppose I have got 4 integer variables and each integer variable takes 2 bytes .PERIOD I am showing 2
bytes here one after the other all right ,COMMA  this is the variable v 1 ,COMMA  this is the variable v 2 ,COMMA  this is the
variable v 3 and this is the variable v 4  .PERIOD 

Similarly let me just change the colour .PERIOD  Let this be in locations- v 1 is in location 1000 assuming
that an integer takes 2 bytes ,COMMA  this one is in location 1002 ,COMMA  this one is in location 1004 and this is
in location 1006 .PERIOD 

Let me extend my table bit ,COMMA  now suppose I have got here 4 integers .PERIOD  So here I have got p 1 is a
pointer variable- since it is a integer let me say- p 2 p 3 and p 4 .PERIOD  I am not bothering about how
many locations it is taking .PERIOD 

I am now not bothering about this division here 2 bytes am just showing those 2 bytes together
that will be easier for me to write all right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here the p 1 is storing the value 1000 why ?QUESTIONMARK  p 1 is
a pointer to this variable .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this p 1 tells me not the value of v 1 ,COMMA  but it tells me where is v 1
located .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  1000 is a position where v 1 is located .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  p 1 is storing that pointer and p 2 is say 1002 ,COMMA  p 3
is 1004 and p 4 is 1006 .PERIOD  Now these locations also have got address- suppose these addresses are
5000 ,COMMA  5002 ,COMMA  5004 and 5006 this 5006 ok .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  please try to understand when I say p 1- what is p 1 ?QUESTIONMARK  p 1 is a pointer to an integer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  int star
p 1 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  that p 1 is an integer all right and p 1 is a pointer to an integer variable  .PERIOD  It could
be a floating point variable .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  had it been a floating point number .PERIOD 

Now suppose each of them is a float .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  float v 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  v 1 is a floating point number .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  then if
p 1 points to v 1 ,COMMA  then I should write float star p 1 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  p 1 is pointing to a floating point
number  .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  since it is a floating point number  ,COMMA if I say now &p1 what will I get ?QUESTIONMARK  what is the address of p
1 ?QUESTIONMARK  what is the address of p 1 address of p 1 is 5000 and what is star p 1 ?QUESTIONMARK  What is the meaning of
this ?QUESTIONMARK  Please do not be confused .PERIOD  This star and this star has got two different meanings ,COMMA  this star

means it is just saying that p 1 is a pointer ,COMMA  pointer to what type of variable ?QUESTIONMARK  Pointer to a floating
point type of variable .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  for v 1 am just writing -float v 1 so ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  that v 1 is purely a floating point number not
a pointer ,COMMA  but when I say float star p 1 ,COMMA  then p 1 is a pointer to some floating number .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  what
is star p 1 in this case what is a content of p  ?QUESTIONMARK Content of p 1 is 1000 So ,COMMA  let me just repeat it once
again .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we have seen in declaration something like int star p 1 int v 1 .PERIOD 

Now ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  p 1 is a pointer  ,COMMA suppose located at location 5000 and p 1 is a pointer to a
variable v 1 ,COMMA  which is also an integer- v 1 located at location thousand .PERIOD 

This two lines are just meaning these two things- this two pictures ,COMMA  this 5000 or 1000 this part is
not known to us ,COMMA  because that is known by the compiler not by us ,COMMA  but logically  ,COMMA  this is the
picture ,COMMA  leave aside this 5000 and 1000  ,COMMA only these 2 parts are declared by this .PERIOD  Now if I say star
p 1 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  the content of p 1 ,COMMA  whatever is the content of p 1 -now if I make p 1 to point to v
1 in that case if I make p 1 point to v 1 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what will that be ?QUESTIONMARK  Content of p 1 should be assigned to &of v 1 .PERIOD  The &of v 1 will give me
the address of this and the content of p 1 will get that .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  this 1000 will be written over
here ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  this pointer is pointed to this v 1 .PERIOD  I will not go in to further details of this right
now ,COMMA  we will come to this as an when the context comes later .PERIOD  Right now we this in mind let us
go back to the algorithm of bubble sort ,COMMA  what is being done on the algorithm of bubble sort .PERIOD 

Let us try to understand each of the functions -first thing is we have got this standard equation .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  first I will start with this function void bubble sort -bubble sort is void ,COMMA  because it is not
returning any value  ,COMMA it is just sorting some element -what array ?QUESTIONMARK  x array and the size of the array
is n ,COMMA  int ij these are 2 local variable because they are using used as indexes of these two loop .PERIOD  In
this loop what is happening ?QUESTIONMARK - for I assigned n minus 1 to 0 ;SEMICOLON  i minus minus ;SEMICOLON  what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
That means ,COMMA  if I have an array here this is my array I have got I pointing here .PERIOD 

Because ,COMMA  that is the size of the array minus 1 .PERIOD So ,COMMA  i is pointing here and it will go up to 0 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
gradually it will go in this direction up .PERIOD  That is what the first for loop is saying .PERIOD  First for loop is
saying that I is starting from the bottom and going up upto 0 as long as it is greater than 0 and
then for j equal to 0 to j less than i  ;SEMICOLON j plus plus .PERIOD If xj is greater than xj plus 1 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  what if
xj is greater than xj plus 1 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  let us again go back to this j is starting from 0 and I am comparing this value 50 with the
value 2 with j plus 1 .PERIOD This is j plus 1 if xj is greater than xj plus 1 ,COMMA  what would I do I would swap .PERIOD 
Let us go into here if xj is greater than xj plus 1 I am swapping xj and xj plus 1 ,COMMA  I will come to
the swap function later am assuming that the swap is working correctly- that means it is
swapping them .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what is happening ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  this loop will go on- j equal to 0 then j will be 1 and in that way it
will go on .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  next when I swap it becomes 2 and 50 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  I have got other values now j is
being incremented .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  this is becoming j and this is becoming j plus 1- in that way this
swapping will be done .PERIOD  Suppose this is 70 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  there will be no swap no swap .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  let us see here ,COMMA  if this condition does not hold -swap is not taking place .PERIOD I am going back to
this loop  .PERIOD Now ,COMMA  70 remains here  .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  now ,COMMA  j changes and j plus 1 is pointing here now there will
be a swap here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is 12 say -12 and 70 will be swapped .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  2 ,COMMA 50 ,COMMA 12 70 in this way I will
go on up to this point and next .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  ultimately in this iteration ultimately I will have this heaviest element say 70 is the heaviest
element ,COMMA  then I will be decremented and I will come here and then from this zone again I will do
the same thing as I did till now  .PERIOD  Exactly that is being done here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will be doing this and then
I will decrement n little bit and I will go on doing this .PERIOD  I will be then looping- doing the same
loop again for 1 level less I mean the last element is already having the heaviest element .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I
will do it among the remaining part .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this part this part is already covered .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have decremented it .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will be now playing in
this zone and once that is done this part will also be coveredI will be playing in this zone  .PERIOD Every
time am deciding on the zone  ,COMMA  n ,COMMA  n minus 1 n minus 2 like that it is going on and every time I am
doing this loop for each of the pair wise element comparison and they are by am pushing the
heaviest element at the bottom .PERIOD  That is the code for bubble sort how it works this swap keeps a I
have not saying this swap .PERIOD  Earlier we have seen that if we do swap in any arbitrary way .PERIOD 

For example ,COMMA  if I want to swap 2 variables say I write swap int a ,COMMA  int b- let me do it here  ,COMMA  if I just
do swap int a ,COMMA  int b and inside I use another variable temp ,COMMA  temp gets a  ,COMMA  a is stored here a gets b
and then temp has been remembered there .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  b gets temp and so ,COMMA  this was my function return .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here suppose a (when it came) it was called with x and y s .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  main program called swap
with x and y and x was 5 ,COMMA  y was 7 right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  x was a location -here 5 and y was a location 7 .PERIOD  Now
when it came here a was a local location and I know that the functions are called by value so ,COMMA  5
was copied in a and 7 was copied in b and then by this temp became 5 ,COMMA  b became 5 and b was
stored in a .PERIOD  This was stored in this -these became 7 and this again became 5 -all right .PERIOD That is how
it was done .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  a was 5 so ,COMMA  temp was 5 .PERIOD  7 went over here to a and here 5 was copied again here- this was
fine .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this swapping was done by a by b and then when I returned no change is reflected in x
and y -that was the problem .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we will now see how the swap function can be implemented .PERIOD Another point is I have just
done return and a function can return only 1 value .PERIOD  I could not return a and b to the main
function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  how can the thing be managed .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that after the swapping the result is reflected
back in the main function .PERIOD  We will see that in the next lecture .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we are discussing about bubble sort and we had looked at some notion of pointers .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you
have now got the preliminary idea about pointers .PERIOD 

On this segment we have seen this part of the code ,COMMA  we have seen - this is the bubble sort
function on this side ,COMMA  we have got a function which is swapping 2 variables .PERIOD  I want to swap x and
y .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this swap function is taking x and y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we have seen earlier that in the normal case if we if
we swap in a function (suppose I have got a void swap xy)

(Refer Slide Time: 01:26)

Then we are shown (we used another variable int temp) that whatever swapping I am doing here
that is not being reflected in the main function ,COMMA  that we saw .PERIOD Now what we are doing here let us
see here I am writing void swap ,COMMA  instead of writing x and y I am writing int star x comma int star
y ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  what I am passing here is my swap function ,COMMA  here is my swap function and it has
got 2 input parameters a function has got always one output ,COMMA  there can be a number of input
parameters earlier it was x and y .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  some variables x and y were having actual parameters being copied into them ,COMMA  but now I
have not used x and y instead I am using pointer to x and pointer to y .PERIOD 

(Refer Slide Time: 03:30)

That means ,COMMA  now I am in my main function -here is my main function or the calling function not
necessarily the main function .PERIOD  In this case it was called from bubble sort .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the calling function
-I should not say main it should the calling function .PERIOD  The calling function has got 2 variables x
and y .PERIOD 

Now when I am calling this function void swap .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am actually having the function here -the
swap function .PERIOD  I am not passing the values of x and y ,COMMA  to be to be more natural let us make this
actual parameters are a and b .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  somehow I am calling here swap in my calling function I am calling swap a comma b .PERIOD  If I
had done this then this value of a and the value of b would have been copied there ,COMMA  but instead
what I am doing now- I will not write this instead I will write int star a and int star b .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can
say here I am passing star a comma star b ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  what ?QUESTIONMARK  I am passing the pointers .PERIOD I will I
will do it again ,COMMA  let us look at this say .PERIOD Here I am passing the address .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  again let me do it in a
nicer way .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is the calling function .PERIOD 

(Refer Slide Time: 06:09)

The calling function has got the variables a and b and inside the calling function I am saying
swap- what should I pass on I instead of saying a and b ,COMMA  I am saying and a comma and b  .PERIOD You
know what is and a and and b ?QUESTIONMARK  And a means the address of a and b means address of b right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
I am actually passing the addresses of a and b .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the address of a was say 1000 and this was
maybe 1500  .PERIOD 

Now here is my called function void swap int ,COMMA  now a and b have been declared- int star x comma
int star y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is happening- what is being passed ?QUESTIONMARK  Here and a is being passed and here and
b is being passed ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  this address and this address are being passed 1000 and 1500 are
being passed .PERIOD 

Also I know here that what I am getting are the pointers to the variables that had to be swapped it was not int x or int y-let us go back to this once again .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here you see I am calling xj and xj
plus1 ,COMMA  in my bubble sort algorithm .PERIOD  In my bubble sort algorithm I had the array and j was here
and j plus one was here- this was already filled something and I am comparing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here is my i .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I will work in this zone and I am looking at two elements j and j plus one and I want to swap
them .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what I am doing is I am passing on the address of this here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  suppose this address was
thousand and this address was 1002 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is being passed here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is 1000 and this is
1002 .PERIOD  Now what is happening here -temp is a local variable ,COMMA  see temp is not a pointer ,COMMA  temp is a
local variable .PERIOD  Suppose here the point was this was 50 and this was 2 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  temp is getting the content of x right ?QUESTIONMARK  So ,COMMA  1000s content thousands content was 50 ,COMMA  content of the pointer ,COMMA  content of x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the 50 is being copied here and then what is happening content of y is coming to content of x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  content of y is coming to content of x .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is becoming 2 ,COMMA  this is being swapped and is becoming 2 and temp is coming as the
content of y .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is becoming 50 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is happening all the changes were reflected here
in the main body of the data .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is how we could really reflect the change on to the calling
function .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  stated in another way it would be like this -let us say I have got a data here and here is my
calling function and here is my called function .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  there is some variable that is being used by the calling function say a ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  this a is
somewhere here ,COMMA  this a has been referred here .PERIOD It is not proper to show it here again .PERIOD  Now the
calling function is using the variable a somewhere here alright .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  when this variable is being
used as a parameter to this called function ,COMMA  instead of sending the variable -say some other
function I call and in that I pass on the address of that variable a .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that address whatever this address is -this is 1000 ,COMMA that is being passed on to this called
function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the called function on the other hand knows that its input parameter is say called
function is f -is int what I am getting is int star x ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  what I am accepting as a called
function is nothing but a pointer to an integer variable .PERIOD 

Now so ,COMMA  the pointer to the integer variables -the 1000 comes up and here suppose it does
something with the content .PERIOD  Now here when I take this say star x ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  x is a pointer x is a
pointer to an integer and when I take star x asterix x ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  its a content of this and
suppose I do it star x plus 1 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  the content of this address same address x was 1000 and
the content of that 1000 is being added .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here it was 50 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is being added  ,COMMA where it is
being added here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is changing to 51 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this if you recall we had talked about two things when the functions are called we said that
usually c always calls by value except for the case of arrays ,COMMA  but here is an example where I can
also say this has been called by value of the pointer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in this case it is an example - call by
value of the pointer .PERIOD  That means ,COMMA  what I have copied it is only the pointer .PERIOD  Therefore ,COMMA  the change
that is being reflected is being reflected in the main program .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  in that way it is also a call by reference .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in that way we can reflect the change of the
function .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if you ever faced the crisis that well I am writing a function ,COMMA  but I know a function
can only return 1 value ,COMMA  but I have got multiple values to return - this is a nice way in which you
can do it  .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this is this we have a new concept we have learnt the use of pointers the notion of pointers
and how it can be used in the context of just learning another language .PERIOD  There is a bubble sort  .PERIOD 
Once again we revise the bubble sort -let us go to the next one and will come back .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  the main program (is taking a main function) is reading an array .PERIOD  This array is being read .PERIOD  I is an integer .PERIOD  Now for i 0 to less than 12 there were 12 elements here- print the array  ,COMMA  it is calling bubble sort with the array being passed and the size of the area being passed here .PERIOD  Now we go to bubble sort ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I go to the earlier slide .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what I had seen earlier .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  there we go and call the bubble sort and the bubble sort in turn calls ,COMMA  swapping is done inside
the bubble sort and then we print the ultimate data all right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  what will be the time complexity .PERIOD We have seen the time complexity in terms of the big o
notation at times .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  what is the worst case - let us once again recapitulate think of the algorithm that for something like this -first I had this size n .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  initially the number of comparisons were 1 then worst case 2 ;SEMICOLON  I first compare between these
two ,COMMA  then I compare between these two ,COMMA  then I compare between these two .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  depending on
the comparison I may or may not exchange all right may not swap ,COMMA  but I have to do n minus one
comparisons .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first I do n minus one comparisons and if along with that I have done the
swapping .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the first position is now filled up with the largest element .PERIOD 

Then again I have to start from here compare again twice ,COMMA thrice .PERIOD In that way I go on comparing
the second time and by now this number of comparisons is n minus 2 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the second one will
also be filled up with the heaviest element and in that way I will go on ultimately last time is 1 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the overall if I add them the number of comparisons is this and that is of the order of n
square ,COMMA  because it breaks down to n square minus n etc .PERIOD What is the best case ?QUESTIONMARK  What will be the
best case ?QUESTIONMARK  The best case is if you do not have to do any swap it is already sorted ,COMMA  but still you do not know that it is sorted you will have to compare them anyway .PERIOD 

Therefore ,COMMA  the best case will be the same .PERIOD  Can you make the best case with n minus 1
comparisons only ?QUESTIONMARK  That we can think of later ,COMMA  So all these searching and sorting we were doing
was using arrays .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  just a word of caution about some common pitfalls with arrays in C -is that often we can
exceed the array bound without really noting of that .PERIOD  For example ,COMMA  array size has been declared
to be 10 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  my indices are from 0 to 9 right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I write a for loop like this and I try
to initialise it .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  it will initialise to 1 0 ,COMMA  then 1 ,COMMA  then 2 ,COMMA  then 3 ,COMMA  till it is less than equal to 10 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the tenth
element is here -that will also be put to 0 ,COMMA  but that may be destroying some other memory
location therefore ,COMMA  that check is not there and c does not support array declarations with variable
expressions .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  quickly if we summarise what we learned here .PERIOD We are not talking about this in this course ,COMMA 
but what we have learned here is searching- we have seen and we have seen two very efficient
methods of searching .PERIOD  One is the linear search which is simple and the better method is saw a
binary search ,COMMA  but binary search is effective when the array is already sorted .PERIOD 

We have learnt about how to sort an array ,COMMA  we have particularly looked at two sorting
algorithms- one is selection sort ,COMMA  another is the bubble sort and while discussing about bubble
sort we have also looked at a very interesting way of communicating between a function a caller
function and the called function ,COMMA  when I have to communicate or pass on or return more than 1
variable to the calling function .PERIOD  There we are using the pointers .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we introduced the concept of pointers which are nothing ,COMMA  but the addresses of the variables .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  instead of passing on the value I am passing on the address and whatever I am doing I am
doing on the address .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is another important thing that we have covered in this lecture .PERIOD 
Next ,COMMA  I think we will go to some other concepts of arrays  .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  just to mention here we have seen that the complexity of these algorithms are of order of n
square both for selection sort and for bubble sort ,COMMA  but can we have it better ?QUESTIONMARK  We have got two
very nice sorting algorithms ;SEMICOLON  one is known as the quick-sort another is known as the merge sort
Quick sort and Merge sort ,COMMA  which reduces the complexity of sorting and are very popular
algorithms ,COMMA  but we are not discussing it in this course for those of you interested can learn it later .PERIOD 

Next we will be moving in the next lecture to discuss about how strings can be handled as arrays -that will do in a separate lecture .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  up to this for now and will continue in the next lecture ok .PERIOD 

Today ,COMMA  we will be having a look at how the techniques that we have learnt can be applied
to different Problem Solving and this will continue from this lecture onwards for a few
more lectures .PERIOD  We have learnt quite a few things we have seen the overall structure of the
C language .PERIOD 
We have seen the if then else if l structure the iteration structure ,COMMA  like the loops we also
know how the variables are defined ,COMMA  we have seen arrays how data can be stored in 1
dimensional array and 2 dimensional arrays ,COMMA  we have also seen functions .PERIOD  And the most
important thing about functions is that it enables us to take a complex problem and
divide it into different parts and solve each of the parts separately using functions .PERIOD  A
very important thing about functions is passing of the parameters and how the function
returns of value returns a value to the calling function .PERIOD 
We have also seen that there are two ways in which parameters can be passed from the
calling function to a called function ,COMMA  one is called by value another one is called by
reference in c language in general always call by value is adopted .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA  in call by value we have to copy the value of the data the parameter value the
parameter value to the argument value .PERIOD  However ,COMMA  for the case of arrays whenever I want
to pass a particular array at that point an array can be a 100 500 array or 10 by 10 array if
it be a 10 by 10 array then I will have to copy hundred values .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is not advisable
for that we just passed the array name .PERIOD 

And let us quickly have a look that the array name is essentially an address right and
array whenever we pass suppose there is an array or 2 dimensional 10 by 10 array all
right 2 dimensional array like this .PERIOD 

Now ,COMMA  all the elements I am not passing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is a essentially it happened to be a 4 by 4
area .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is all the 16 elements I will not be passing .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here is my called function
the function called function and on this side is the calling function ,COMMA  the calling function

and the array name is say a .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the calling function refers to suppose let this function be
called f .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  in from the body of the calling function whenever I am calling f ,COMMA  I am passing the
array say if it be an integer array into A .PERIOD  And here I just passed the array A and here in
this function body we have got say int A and just saying that the size of the or if it may
not be a it can be x also ,COMMA  int x something and the size of that and here int A and maybe n .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  here I am actually passing the name of the array and the name of the array is nothing ,COMMA 
but the beginning of the address of the first element of the array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  here I am actually
copying the address .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  it is a call by reference in the case of an array .PERIOD  And in the last lecture we have also
seen that we can also use pointers to sort of establish call by reference .PERIOD  Another major
thing that you have to keep in mind is that suppose this array is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  these are organized in C in a row major form .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is stored in the
memory like 1 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the rows first 2 3 4 then 5 6 like that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  when I refer to the array A I
actually pass on the address of the first location of the array ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  A 0 0 in the case of
A 2 dimensional array points to this element and that is this element that is how we pass
on arrays .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  for functions and we have also seen some applications of all these techniques that we
have learnt in particular we have seen how we can carry out search .PERIOD 

And we have seen two search techniques one is linear search another is binary search .PERIOD 
Now in linear search the complexity the time is proportional to the number of elements
whereas ,COMMA  in binary search it is reduced it is faster it is log of the number of elements to
the base 2 .PERIOD  And search is a very fundamental problem solving technique in technique ,COMMA 
because suppose you have got the names of students in the class all right .PERIOD 
Here are the names Atul ,COMMA  Shyam ,COMMA  Gargi in that way the names are there and each of them
have got a roll number 1 2 3 4 .PERIOD  Now you want to find out how many Shyams are there in
the class .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you have to search this array and find out where Shyam is ok ,COMMA  maybe here
and there is another Shyam here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is searching and counting both the things ,COMMA  but
you cannot avoid searching this array all right .PERIOD  It may be that along with that there is an
array of marks obtained by roll number 1 roll number 2 etcetera .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  maybe this is 50 this is 70 this is 30 all right .PERIOD  Now here tell me I want to say now
they are in 2 arrays this is 1 array called name and this is another array called marks of
the corresponding students .PERIOD  Now I want to know how much what is the marks that Gargi
has obtained .PERIOD  How do you go about it what would be the first step in solving this
problem what is the marks that Gargi has opted ,COMMA  in order to do that I have to first I do not
know what is Gargi is roll number .PERIOD 
If I had known what is Gargis roll number suppose Gargis roll number is 3 ,COMMA  then I
could have gone in the marks array and I could have taken marks roll number what if I
knew the roll number ,COMMA  roll number minus 1 that marks I could have taken as a result all
right ,COMMA  but I do not know the roll number if I had known the rule number 3 then I would
have gone to the second element .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is marks 2 would have been would have given
me the roll number ,COMMA  but suppose I do not know the roll number then what should I do ?QUESTIONMARK 
First I will have to search this area and what would be my key what is my key will be the
screen Gargi ,COMMA  because I want to know the marks obtained by Gargi and what should I do
with this key I should carry out a search ,COMMA  it can be a linear search or it can be a binary
search let us for the time being assume that it is a linear search .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  we will be searching
and I will be finding Gargi here I am assuming for simplicity that there is only one Gargi
in the class .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I will take this and I find what will the search ,COMMA  if you recall what will the search
algorithm return me the search algorithm will return me the index of the position where

Gargi is located .PERIOD  And that position will be actually it will automatically come since this
positions will be marked as 0 1 2 I will get this 2 returned .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will get .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I get the key
I search the array name this is a character array A care name size whatever size is say n
and the key .PERIOD 
And this search will return me the value position 2 pos equal to 2 ,COMMA  then I will simply take
the value of marks I go to the array marks pos ,COMMA  which will be my result right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  you see
we needed the searching .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  while I was talking of searching this array I said that the
searching I am assuming this searching to be a linear search .PERIOD 
Would it be possible to sort this array using binary search ,COMMA  if you just think it over would
it be possible to search ,COMMA  it using binary search what does binary search require binary
search requires that the array be sorted right array be sorted .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  an array like this ,COMMA  Atul ,COMMA  Amal ,COMMA  Gargi and Joy this is an array of 4 elements can I sort
it the type of sort if ,COMMA  I want to sort it I will have to organize it in increasing or decreasing
order let us assume that I am trying to do it in an increasing order .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  this sort will be
this character array can be sorted in an way which is called the lexicographic sort .PERIOD 
That means I go I sort the character array according to the alphabets or the words as they
written ;SEMICOLON  obviously ,COMMA  A comes first .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  therefore ,COMMA  A character A is smaller than character
B all right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here between these two elements both of them has got A ,COMMA  but similarly t is greater
than m .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in this sorting I will first check between these say a they are same think of
bubble sort I am trying to compare them in normally what we did we found that say array
x xj is less than xj plus 1 and then we did something .PERIOD 
If it was if it is the case no issue if it was the other way round I wanted to do a swap ,COMMA  but
in this case it will not be .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  simple I can take a string and compare these two strings as
to which one is whether they are same or not or whichever is greater ,COMMA  but another way
you can write a small function to compare I leave it to you I leave it to you that you now
know sorting techniques .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  you should try to write a function that will sort a string of characters all right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  e
and e are same ,COMMA  if they are same the function what will do it will now look at t and m
now m is smaller than t therefore ,COMMA  Amal is smaller than Atul .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  Amal will come here and Atul will come here now between Atul and Gargi you can
see a is greater than smaller than G .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  Gargi is in a proper space please .PERIOD  Now if say for
example ,COMMA  I do not have Joy here I am having another name Gautam here .PERIOD  Now when I am
comparing between Gargi and Gautam G and G are the same .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  they are equal no change next a and a are also same no issue .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  there is no change ,COMMA 
but r r is smaller than u ,COMMA  because r appears earlier than u ,COMMA  but in terms of our computer
code technology the Ascii code of r is less than the ascii code of you .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  in both the ways it is meaningful .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  r is less than you therefore ,COMMA  Gargi is smaller
than Gautam .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in that way I can carry out with another small function compare string
is greater say is you can write a function is greater 2 strings ok ,COMMA  care S 1 comma care S 2
2 strings will be passed on this function and this function will find out ,COMMA  which character if
S 1 is greater than is 2 ,COMMA  it will just return if S 1 is greater than is 2 it will return A 1 if S 1
is greater than S 2 try to write such a function ok .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  that is that I am giving you as a
home assignment all of you should try to do that and with a little effort I am sure you
will be able to do that .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I could have just as I had done in the earlier one ,COMMA  here in this thing I said that I will be
doing linear search ,COMMA  I could have done binary search also provided I had provided ,COMMA  I had
sorted them provided I had sorted them in a proper way and then with the sorted array I

could have done binary search .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  will be also doing some problem solving within
this course will be doing some problem solving in the field of numbers or equations
mathematical problem solving ,COMMA  but before that in order to do this today let us have a
relook at the strings ,COMMA  we had looked at strings earlier as an array of characters .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  let us have a relook at the whole thing today how can I represent an array of strings
like the one that ,COMMA  I was showing here and array of strings all these names Atul ,COMMA  Amal ,COMMA 
Gargi ,COMMA  and Gautam all these are nothing ,COMMA  but this is a string this is a string all these are
different strings .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  how can I represent them let us have a look at that .PERIOD 

Say I can I have got 3 strings one is spike and there is tom and there is jerry .PERIOD  Now these 3
strings I have to store and I am saying that each string can be at best 10 characters at
most 10 characters .PERIOD  And I am looking at 3 such names .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is an array 3 rows and each
row having 10 characters right .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  the definite that definition would be I named them as
char I could have done character array and it is 3 rows and 10 columns now I can
initialize that as spike as character S character p .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  s comes here ,COMMA  p comes here ,COMMA  i comes here ,COMMA  k comes here ,COMMA  e comes here and that is the
end .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is backslash 0 I also put that and so ,COMMA  1 2 3 4 5 6 4 places are still vacant 4
places are still vacant .PERIOD  Similarly for the next 1 is tom so ,COMMA  t o m back slash 0 and the rest
are rest 6 are all free all right ,COMMA  but my string has ended here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  1 way I is that I can
represent them in this way where ,COMMA  I specifically talk about the characters in the array and
terminate them with backslash 0 .PERIOD  The other way I can do it is simply I initialize them .PERIOD 

As 3 10 the same array with 3 strings spike comma ,COMMA  tom comma ,COMMA  jerry .PERIOD  Now internally
even if I do that it is essentially becoming the same thing internally it is being stored in
the same way with 3 rows and each row having this characters s p i k e backslash 0 and
so and so forth ,COMMA  there can be more t o m back slash 0 and so and so forth here .PERIOD 
Also j e r r y and so ,COMMA  on I am sorry backslash 0 and so and so forth it is being stored .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
both of them are equivalent I can do it in either of these ways alright .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  a string can be
represented in any of these ways .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we already know this again the name of the array is appointed to the 0th element of
the array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if I have this array s p i k e backslash 0 ,COMMA  t o m backslash 0 ,COMMA  j e r r y
backslash 0 when I am calling that charr the name itself is pointing to the first element of
this array .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  ch arr 0 0 it is pointing to that .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this and ch arr 0 0 are the same they mean the same thing ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this you just like an
array this is also true here .PERIOD 

Therefore ,COMMA  if ch_arr points to the address 1000 ch_arr plus 1 will point to address 1010 ,COMMA 
why the reason is again I have got this array .PERIOD 

And ch_arr is pointing ch-ar arr is pointing to the 0 element of the first row ,COMMA  if this is
1000 .PERIOD  Then 1002 ,COMMA  1009 this array this location is 1009 ,COMMA  because the size is 10 size is 10 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  although s p i k e backslash 0 etcetera is there ,COMMA  then when I go to the next one ch
underscore arr plus 1 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  whatever this pointer arrays the entire thing is taken 0
to 10 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I am taking here it is taking all these 10 elements as 1 array it will be pointing
to the next one ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  it will be 1010 ok .PERIOD 
Again if I make it ch-arr plus 2 it will come to this 1 all right that is how the pointer
works ,COMMA  but how can I get this character this will be ch-arr 0 1 that is pointing to this
element ok .PERIOD  Now this thing must be clearly understood .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  ch-arr points 0 th string or
the 0 th 1 dimensional array ch-arr 1 points to the first string or the first 1 dimensional
array I mean number 1 0 at first ch-arr 2 points the second 1 dimensional array .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  each of them are 1 dimensional arrays and ch ar is pointing to each of these 1
dimensional arrays ch-arr is pointing to 1 one dimensional array .PERIOD  And as I increment the
pointer this pointer is going on increasing alright in general ch-arr I points to the I th
string of the yet 1 dimensional array clear .PERIOD 

The following program let us look at the program and the following program
demonstrates how to print an array of strings ?QUESTIONMARK  Please take 1 minute to read this array a
program yourself and try to understand .PERIOD  It you can see here that I am starting with the
main function and although it is written in a 1 in a very cryptic way .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  my program
starts from this point and ends at this point ,COMMA  i is an integer ch-arr is again an array of 3
strings and each can be of maximum length 10 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  spike tom and jerry are there .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I can print I just print first way next line I go to next line and to next line .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I just
put first way and then what do I do .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I will print first way and then 2 lines have been
given blank ,COMMA  then for i 0 2 less than 3 i plus plus printf string ,COMMA  I am printing the string .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
what will be printed string equals a placeholder for the string and then there will be some
tab 1 space and then .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the first will be string here some space and then tab this is tab .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  I give some space and write address and then sorry string equal to string equal to
address equal to and there should be some space for the address and that format is
unsigned integer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it will become longer alright .PERIOD 
Because unsigned and signed integer a whenever I am putting suppose I have got 16 bits
for representing an integer .PERIOD  If it be assigned if I distinguish between plus 5 and minus 5
and keep 1 bit kept for the plus or minus then for the 16 bit I will be actually having 15
bits for this size ,COMMA  but if I make it unsigned then I can have all these 16 bits .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can
represent more numbers all right more numbers .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  that apart so ,COMMA  string and address and then what am I printing here care I care plus i ;SEMICOLON 
that means ,COMMA  0 care 0 the first string and then I am again putting the care this ,COMMA  now what is
the difference between this care this and this is being printed in percentage arrays ;SEMICOLON  that
means ,COMMA  the string will be printed and here in an unsigned integer what I am printing here
is the address of that string .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this string spike was here when I print this just the name of the array ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  I
am in this format if I do I am printing the address of it therefore ,COMMA  the output will be
somehow like this ok .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this is something to be understood very clearly that this array

when I am actually looking at this I am taking the content of the array otherwise I am
taking the array itself .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  here is a program .PERIOD 

This program asks the user to enter a username if the username entered is one of the
names in the master list then the user is allowed to calculate the factorial of a number
otherwise an error message is displayed .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  we have got sorry a master list of names now if you are a valid user your name is
there in the list .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  first what is doing it is including stdio dot h it is including string dot
h ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  some string functions are also included I am defining the factorial
prototype the factorial function has been written later .PERIOD  Suppose this part this part is later
than the main function ok .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA  the main is here and what is the main doing it has got some integer I and found is 0
initially the name is not found here and some n number for which I have to compute the
factorial ,COMMA  master list 5 by 20 ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  each of these each of these can be 20 character
long and there are 5 search .PERIOD  And I put the valid names as admin tom ,COMMA  bob ,COMMA  tim ,COMMA  and jim .PERIOD 
Now I am asking a name is so ,COMMA  I am and I am asking from the user enter user name now
the user gives the name .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  get s here you are getting a new function being introduced
here that is get s what is get s get care get ch ,COMMA  you know and here the get s means get the
string .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  in 1 short it is getting the string as the name .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  name I am getting from the user some name say it is jim suppose the user enters jim .PERIOD 
Now for I equals to 0 to 5 why 5 there are all the 5 names are here if string compare
name and master list I ,COMMA  if this character this string and this string matches then found is 1 ,COMMA 
otherwise I am again going in the fall loop .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  at every stage of the loop I am trying to compare this name with this string here there
is no match .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I come here no match no match in that way I come and find jim .PERIOD  So ,COMMA 
here ultimately I will get found and then I will break .PERIOD  Now when I come out suppose it
was not jim ,COMMA  it was say jimmy alright then I do not get a match here .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I can come out
with found equal to 0 or found equal to 1 ,COMMA  he found equal to 1 then welcome then
welcome exclamation and then the name it is printing welcome jim .PERIOD 
And asking please enter the number is entering the number for the factorial and then here
you see in this printf I have called the factorial ,COMMA  that factorial of the number is this n is
this so ,COMMA  I call factorial and this part you know .PERIOD  Now that this n and this n and may not be
the same I mean they are two different locations ,COMMA  but they same it could have been x also
in that case internally had it had to be x here .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  this is being passed over here and the factorial is being computed all right .PERIOD  Once the
factorial is computed ,COMMA  now how the factorial is computed I will be discussing that later ,COMMA 

because here there is some trick forget about that trick now I will be discussing that later
that is recursion ,COMMA  which you have not yet discussed and after this I am coming back here
and I am printing .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA  the purpose of this program was to show how we can handle strings .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  these are
very common very common thing I mean you try to login in a machine right .PERIOD  And you
type in your login name and your password ,COMMA  if they do not match the system says login
failure now how does it do it internally .PERIOD 
Internally it has got a list of just like this it has got a list of all the users and it takes your
username and checks it with all these .PERIOD  That is a problem that is being solved a sub
problem that is being solved in the operating system and that is the basic principle is
depicted in this program alright we will continue with other problem solving approaches
in the future lectures .PERIOD 

Today ,COMMA  we will be looking at some real engineering applications of programming .PERIOD  We will see
how ,COMMA  whatever we have learnt till now can be applied to solve some interesting problems like
solving equations .PERIOD  One very common thing that we need in any engineering or science is to
represent data .PERIOD  One way of representing data is by in the form of a table right .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I can always represent some data as a table where say on one column it can be height or
depth and maybe as we go down ,COMMA  we go through some point and at different depths ,COMMA  we put
some sensor and get the temperature .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  that I can represent in the form of whatever is a depth- 50 meters ,COMMA  some temperature ,COMMA  100
meters ,COMMA  some temperature etcetera .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  if we need to represent any data in this form we know
how to do it ?QUESTIONMARK  We know that as it looks here -we can immediately say we will be representing it
as an array .PERIOD  Whether I will be representing them using as 1 array 1 2 dimensional array or two
different array - will depend on the format of the data the type of the data .PERIOD 

For example if the depth is integer and the temperature is real ,COMMA  then up to the knowledge that we
have acquired till now will be representing them in the form of 2 arrays ,COMMA  1 is an integer array
another is a separate floating point array  .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  that is oneway of representing data as we have
done also in the case of students roll number and marks earlier .PERIOD  Another very interesting and
important thing is representing graphs .PERIOD 

For example ,COMMA  I want to represent a graph say this is some pressure and this is depth and as this
graph shows that it is not increasing in a uniform way with depth .PERIOD  There could be some graph ,COMMA 
which would be just linear .PERIOD  We call it linear ,COMMA  where along with depth this increases in a linear
fashion ,COMMA here it is non-linear  .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  the question is how do we represent this sort of graph ?QUESTIONMARK  Now you know that in this graph I
can also state that this is the X axis and my independent variable is x and the dependent variable
is y ,COMMA  then this graph essentially represents a function ,COMMA  which is y ,COMMA  a function of x .PERIOD  Now depending
on the nature of variation of the dependent variable with the independent variable ,COMMA  the nature of
the function will vary .PERIOD  This one will be a linear function right .PERIOD 

For example it can be y equals to some k x .PERIOD  This one is more complex I could have had a
quadratic function also this is a linear function .PERIOD  Now the question that we would like to first

address is that it is so very nice to draw a picture on a piece of paper ;SEMICOLON  however ,COMMA  a computer will
not be able to just interpret this picture as we do then in that case how do we represent this graph in a computer .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  let us do it again .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I have got a graph let us say a linear graph and I can say that for different values of x what is the corresponding value of y ?QUESTIONMARK  Now this is a linear one .PERIOD  If x and y are the same type I can also
represent them in the form of a table ;SEMICOLON  that means ,COMMA  a 2 dimensional array ,COMMA  where one side ,COMMA  one
dimension is the variation of x on one column we have got the x and the corresponding y all
right .PERIOD 

What will be the number of rows ?QUESTIONMARK  The number of data points of x that we take will be the
number of rows .PERIOD  How many ?QUESTIONMARK - n and this one is fixed to be 2 .PERIOD  I can suppose that this is 5 .PERIOD 0 and
this is 25 .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I have 5 here I have 25 here - this array is of type float now here it is ten .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  it is
50 ,COMMA  it may be 15 .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  this one will be 30 ,COMMA  because I am talking of a linear curve it need not be linear all the time .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  I can also have a curve like this ,COMMA  say something like this and here again I have got the y and
here I have got the x .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  with a particular value of x say 5 ,COMMA  maybe this 1 is initially .PERIOD  Let us say it
has risen a little sharp so ,COMMA  maybe it is 7 and if I go here .PERIOD  Now ,COMMA  please note that we usually take the
samples at equal distances .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  I take it as 10 ,COMMA  but here it will not be doubling .PERIOD  it is becoming a
little more than that .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  7  ,COMMA it may be 16 .PERIOD  I go here now ,COMMA  you see the slope of this curve has
reduced right the gradient has reduced .PERIOD 

So ,COMMA  at 15 it will not increase that much ,COMMA  it will be 18 ,COMMA  because it is still flattening out and here
there is a sharp change etcetera  .PERIOD  So ,COMMA  this one also I can represent in the form of a table like say I have a 2 di
